<small>THE WAY OF THE HUN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The three-masted schooner <i>Jonas Clinton</i>
was loafing along in a six-knot breeze
some five hundred miles off the coast of
France. For the time of year, the middle of
October, the Atlantic in those latitudes was unusually
docile and there was scarcely enough swell
to slant the schooner’s deck. Overhead, a moon
in its first quarter was playing hide-and-seek in a
bank of purple-black clouds. The night—the
ship’s clock in the cabin had just struck five bells—was
so mild that the helmsman had not yet troubled
to button his heavy reefer.</p>

<p>Light winds, or no wind at all, had been the
<i>Jonas Clinton’s</i> fortune for a month. The eastward
voyage had been made in twenty-two days,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Boston to Havre, but once rid of her cargo of
lubricating oil for the armies in France, she had
been forced to swing at anchor for two weeks.
At last, despairing of a fair wind, Captain Troy
had had the schooner towed across to Falmouth,
England. Another wait had followed, a delay
especially regrettable when ships were scarce and
freight rates high. But at last a brisk breeze had
started the <i>Jonas Clinton</i> on her homeward voyage
only to peter out at the end of the second
day, leaving the skipper, who, as half owner in
the ship, was deeply concerned in her fortunes,
decidedly glum. The skipper’s frame of mind
was reflected by everyone else aboard, from Mr.
Cupples, the mate, down to the latest addition to
the crew of eight, the tall, raw-boned Nova Scotian
lad who, whatever his real name might be,
was known as “Bean Pole”; though the gloom
extended in a lesser degree to two inhabitants of
the four hundred ton craft, Nelson Troy and
Pickles.</p>

<p>These two were at the moment seated side by
side on the forward hatch, as though awaiting
this introduction. Nelson, Captain Troy’s son,
was seventeen, a well-built, nice-looking lad who
was making his second voyage in his father’s ship.
He was down on the ship’s papers as apprentice,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
since a merchant vessel may not carry passengers,
but his position as a member of the crew was
nominal rather than actual. Not, however, that
he didn’t take a hand when there was something
to be done, for he had picked up a fair amount
of sailoring, and, perhaps, had inherited a taste
for it. He was a broad-shouldered, healthy boy,
full of fun and very fond of Pickles.</p>

<p>Pickles was—well, Pickles was just Pickles.
First of all, he was a dog. Beyond that I hesitate
to go. Leo, the big, two-fisted Swede who
had sailed with Captain Troy for seven years, declared
that “he ban part wolf-dog an’ part big
fool.” But that was scarcely fair to Pickles, because,
no matter how mixed he was in the matter
of breed, he was certainly no fool. Even Terry,
the cook, acknowledged that. No dog capable
of stealing a piece of mutton as big as his head
from right under the cook’s nose can rightly be
called a fool. And Terry didn’t call him a fool,
although he applied several other names to him!
Visibly, Pickles was yellow as to color, shaggy as
to coat, loving and faithful as to disposition. For
the rest, he was long-legged and big in the shoulders,
and just too much for a lapful.</p>

<p>Captain Troy, keeping the first watch, came
along the deck from the stern, a tall, rather gaunt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
figure in the dim light, and paused where Nelson
and Pickles sat. The captain was well on toward
fifty and had followed the sea, boy and man, for
more than thirty years, just as his father and his
father’s father before him had followed it. Several
generations of Troys had been born within
sight and sound of Casco Bay and had taken to
the sea as naturally and inevitably as ducks take
to water. The captain was a slow-speaking man,
with a deep and pleasant voice that could, when
occasion demanded, bellow like a liner’s fog-horn.
He was a good Master, stern but never unjust,
and a good father to the boy who sat there holding
the front half of the dog across his knees.
Nelson not only loved his father very deeply—how
deeply he was very soon to realize—but he
both admired and respected him. No one could
make two trips over and back with Captain Troy,
watching his handling of his ship, his behavior in
moments of peril and his attitude toward the men
under him, without feeling admiration and respect
for the simple-minded, big-hearted, cool-thinking
man. The fact that Nelson’s mother
had died when he was eight years of age had focused
all his affection on his father, and, since
Nelson was an only child, had, on the other hand,
concentrated all the captain’s love on him. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
being father and son they were excellent
companions, and neither was quite contented when
away from the other.</p>

<p>The captain gazed up at the half-filled foresail.
“I’m fearing it’s to be light winds all the
way across,” he said. “I hate the thought of going
into steam at my time of life, but there’s no
denying that a couple of screws aft there would
be a big help just now. If I knew where to pick
up a small steamship I’m not sure I wouldn’t take
her over, son, for the next voyage. It’s maddening
to think of all the cargoes awaiting bottoms
back home, and us wallowing along at five or six
knots; and in ballast, at that!”</p>

<p>“Mustn’t be greedy, dad,” answered the boy,
smiling up in the dark. “We made a pile of
money this trip, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Money? Yes, we did pretty well,” replied
the captain with satisfaction. “I’ve been blowing
east and west, north and south most of my
life, son, and this is nearly the first time that big
money has come my way. We ain’t rich, and
I’d like to see a bit more in the bank before I
quit. You’ll be needing some, and so’ll I when
I join the fireside fleet.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry about me, dad. I’m going
to earn my own money in a year or two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe, but not so soon as that. You’re going
to finish your education first, I’m hoping. I
want you to have all the trimmings before you
take the wheel. Have you thought any more
about that college?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” owned the boy. “There have
been so many other things to think about, you
see.” His tone if not his words implied that the
other things were far more interesting. “Anyway,
there’s time enough. I’ll have to put in another
year in high school, I suppose.” His voice
dropped dismally at the end, and the captain
chuckled.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re like all the Troys. There
never was one of ’em I ever heard tell of that was
much of a scholar. Your great-uncle Joab got
to be a Judge of the Supreme Court, but I always
suspicioned that he did it by keeping his mouth
clamped down and not letting on to how little he
really knew about the Law! That’s one trait the
Troys have generally possessed, and it’s a good
one.”</p>

<p>“What, not knowing much?” laughed the boy.</p>

<p>“Not saying much. There’s more men have
talked themselves out of their jobs than you can
shake a stick at. Just you remember that, son,
and every time you’re tempted to say something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
when you ain’t got anything to say, you just clap
the hatch on. And then,” he added, “sit on it,
just as you’re doing now!” The captain craned
his head a little for a look at the dim spread of
the jib. “I’ll feel a sight easier,” he muttered,
“when we’re five hundred miles further west.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t afraid of U-boats, are you, dad?”
asked Nelson, smiling as he pulled at the dog’s
ears.</p>

<p>“I’m not exactly afraid of them, no, but ‘accidents’
have happened before this, and I’m kind
of fond of this little ship.”</p>

<p>“But, dad, we’re not at war with Germany.
They wouldn’t——”</p>

<p>“Well, there was the <i>William P. Frye</i>,” replied
the captain dryly. “They got her, didn’t
they? And we weren’t at war with her then,
neither. Any more than we were when they sank
the <i>Lusitania</i>,” he added bitterly.</p>

<p>“But I’ve always thought that was—was different,”
said Nelson, vaguely. “She was British,
dad, and——”</p>

<p>“I know,” interrupted his father roughly.
“She was British, but she had American citizens
aboard, and Germany knew it. I’d rather you
didn’t try to excuse Germany for that deed, son;
I—I’m likely to lose my temper. Well, ain’t it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
most time you turned in? Or are you considering
taking the graveyard watch to-night?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t really late yet,” laughed the boy.
“It’s such a peachy night that I hate to go below.
So does Pickles, don’t you, you old rascal?”</p>

<p>Apparently he did, for he wagged a stiff tail
enthusiastically and burrowed his nose further
into the crook of the boy’s arm.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t make it too late,” advised his
father, turning away. “If I find you on deck at
seven bells I’ll put you in the lazaret on hard
tack and water for the rest of the voyage.” With
which dire threat Captain Troy strode off toward
the stern.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, boy and dog sat a few minutes
longer, and then, finding that the breeze was
seeking them out, arose. Nelson yawned deeply
and Pickles wagged his tail, as they went sleepily
aft to the companion. As Nelson’s head dropped
below the deck level he caught an uncertain
glimpse of his father’s form by the helmsman and
a glowing speck that showed that Leo’s pipe was
drawing well. Nelson shared his father’s cabin,
and twenty minutes later he was sound asleep
there, while Pickles, half under the bunk and half
out, twitched his legs and made little sounds,
dreaming, perhaps, that he was doing battle royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
with some long-whiskered, squeaking denizen of
the hold.</p>

<p>Seven bells had struck some time ago, when
Nelson was midway between sleeping and waking,
and now it was close on midnight. From
across the passage came the deep snores of Mr.
Cupples. The mate was a vigorous, hearty man
even when he slumbered. In the dimly lighted
captain’s cabin Pickles, having vanquished his adversary,
sighed and stretched his long legs into
new positions, without waking, and the boy above,
dreaming, too, doubtless, muttered faintly in his
sleep. And then——</p>

<p>And then he awoke to chaos!</p>

<p>The first disturbing sound had been a dull,
crackling <em>thud</em> from somewhere forward, and the
schooner had reeled and shivered with the shock
as though she had driven head-on to a reef. The
second sound had followed so close on the heels
of the first that it had been virtually but a continuation
of it. Nelson was never certain that he
had heard the first sound at all, for he came fully
awake with his ears fairly splitting with the awful
concussion that shook the ship. The noise was
beyond imagination, and yet so peculiar that he
knew instinctively what it meant.</p>

<p>An explosion!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>Confused, frightened, too, if the truth must be
told, he struggled from his berth. The light was
out. Somewhere in the darkness Pickles was
whimpering. On deck were shouts and the rushing
of heavy feet. The cabin floor slanted amazingly
and Nelson, groping for the passage, found
the door swung wide and had to pull himself
through the aperture with a hand on each side
of the frame. He remembered the dog then and
called. But his heart was beating too loudly for
him to know whether Pickles followed as, clinging
to whatever his groping hands encountered,
he made his way to the companion. As he set
foot on the lowest step another rending shock
shook the <i>Jonas Clinton</i>, and there was the sound
of splintering wood and the crash of yards and
tackle to the deck above.</p>

<p>He knew then. His father’s half-felt fear had
not been unwarranted, it seemed. Nelson’s fright
gave way to a swift flood of anger, and as he hastened
on deck, he trembled with the tempest of
his wrath.</p>

<p>Even in the moonlit darkness the little schooner
presented a pitiable sight. She was already far
down at the head. Her foremast was broken
short off and the great foresail shrouded the deck
and dragged over the side. The first shell from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the unseen enemy had entered the hull aft the galley
and just above the water-line and the succeeding
explosion had opened the seams wide and piled
the fore part of the ship with destruction. The
second shot had gone high and taken the foremast
ten feet from deck. As he looked, spellbound
at the head of the companion, the schooner’s
bowsprit disappeared under the surface and
the stern, with its idly swinging, deserted wheel,
rose higher against the purple-black sky. Amidship
on the starboard side there was confused
shouting and the squeak of tackle where a boat
was being lowered. Nelson hurried toward it just
as with a whine, a third shell passed the stern.</p>

<p>There were but four men at the boat. One
was Mr. Cupples, the mate, and one was Leo.
The other two were sailors whom the boy didn’t
identify until later. He caught Mr. Cupples’
arm.</p>

<p>“Where’s dad?” he cried anxiously.</p>

<p>“Lower away! What? Is that you, Nelson?
Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Where’s father, sir?”</p>

<p>“In with you, quick, lad! There’ll be another
shell on us in a minute.”</p>

<p>“But I want to know where dad is! I don’t
see him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>“He’s coming,” said Mr. Cupples gruffly. “Skippers
stand by to the last, lad. Over you go now.”</p>

<p>“Well——!” And then Nelson remembered
Pickles. He called him but got no answering
bark nor sound of scampering feet. Pickles, then,
was still below! He turned, deaf to the cries of
the mate and the others, and hurried up the canted
deck and plunged again into the after cabin.</p>

<p>“Pickles!” he called. “Pickles! Where are
you?” And then he heard a whine, and went
stumbling, falling into the little compartment
where the floor was already an inch deep in sea
water. For a moment he couldn’t find the dog,
but then another whine led him right and he gathered
the frightened animal in his arms and hastened
out again, sobbing reassurances and endearments,
and all the time panic-stricken with a terror
he couldn’t formulate, but that had to do with
the amazing fact that his father had not come for
him. On deck again, he sped to the side. The
little boat was in the water and as his head showed
over the rail Mr. Cupples called to him to jump.</p>

<p>“Catch Pickles,” he answered, and dropped the
dog. “Is father down there? Are you there,
dad?”</p>

<p>But it was Leo who answered. “Sure, he ban
here in boat. Yump, Nels!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Nelson jumped—the distance now was but a
few feet—and landed safely between thwarts.
<a href="#i_fp012">Oars dashed at the water and the boat headed
away.</a> Nelson, recovering himself, peered about.
It seemed lighter here than on the schooner’s deck,
and it took him but an instant to learn the truth.
He leaped to his feet again despairingly.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_13">Oars dashed at the water and the boat headed away.</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“He isn’t here! You lied to me! Where is
he?” he cried.</p>

<p>An arm pulled him back to the seat and Mr.
Cupples’ voice came to him from the dimness,
broken and husky.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t find him, Nelson. He must have
been forward when the first shot hit us. I think
he was—I’m afraid——” The mate’s voice trailed
off into silence. A fourth shot struck the schooner.
They could see the brief scarlet glare of the bursting
shell and hear the havoc caused by the flying
shrapnel. But Nelson neither saw nor heard. He
was staring dumbly, agonizedly into the night,
while Pickles, clasped close in his arms, whimpered
his sympathy.</p>

<small>WITH THE COAST PATROL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The U. S. S. <i>Wanderer</i> plunged her nose
into the blue-green waters of Nantucket
Sound, tossed them high in glittering
spray that rattled against the slanting glass of the
little wheel-house—only they liked to call it the
bridge on the <i>Wanderer</i>—and raced on at a good
twenty knots, leaving a fine hillock of sea under
her low taffrail and a long snow-white wake behind.
It was a brisk, sunshiny morning in late
April. A blue sky that held a half-cargo of cottony
clouds grayed into mist at the horizon. A
few points off the starboard bow Handkerchief
Light Ship swayed her stumpy poles and marked
the southern limit of the four mile shoal. Beyond,
the sandy shore of Cape Cod glistened in the sunlight,
and to port Nantucket Island came abreast.</p>

<p>The <i>Wanderer</i> was but ninety-six feet over all
and was built with the slender proportions of a
cigar. Barely more than a month ago she had
been a private cruising yacht, but a fortnight in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Boston basin had changed her appearance greatly.
Now she was the color of tarnished pewter from
stem to stern, from keel to tip of signal pole.
Her deck was bare save for a rapid fire gun at
the bow and a three-pounder aft and a gray tender
swung inboard amidships. Below, however, something
of her former magnificence remained in the
form of mahogany and egg-shell white and gold
lines, but curtains and soft cushions and similar
luxuries had been sternly abolished. She carried
a personnel of fourteen, Naval Reserves all, for
the <i>Wanderer</i> was listed as Number 167 of the
Coast Patrol. Of the fourteen, two were commissioned
officers, Lieutenant Hattuck and Ensign
Stowell, five were petty officers and the rest
were seamen, if we except that worthy and popular
personage “Spuds,” whose real name was
Flynn and whose rating was that of ship’s cook
of the fourth class.</p>

<p>The commander was an ex-Navy man, his junior
a yachtsman of experience. The chief machinist
had come from a Great Lakes freighter and his
mate had run a ferry in Portland Harbor. Some
of the others were ex-service men, but the electrician
was just out of the Radio School and three
of the seamen had been swinging their hammocks
in the barracks at Newport a month ago. Of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
latter trio, one was a well set-up youth of barely
eighteen, with a pair of very blue eyes and a good-looking
face set in rather serious lines. There
was something about the lad that impressed one
with a sense of ability and determination; or perhaps
it was a number of things, such as the firm
molding of his chin, the straight set of his mouth,
the back-throw of his broad shoulders or the quiet,
direct way of speaking. In the ten days that the
<i>Wanderer</i> had been on duty most of its occupants
had come into nicknames, or had brought them
with them, and this boy was known as “Chatty.”
It was Cochran, GM2C, who had labeled him
the first night at sea when, clustered in the tiny
forward cabin that served as forecastle, those off
watch had proceeded to get acquainted. The
boy, a second class seaman, had had so little to
say that the gunner’s mate had finally turned on
him with a sarcastic: “Say, Jack, you’re a chatty
guy, aren’t you? Come across with a few words,
just to show there’s no hard feeling!” For the
rest of the evening Cochran had addressed him
as “Chatty” and the nickname had stuck. Now,
aside from the officers, it is doubtful if anyone
aboard knew the boy’s real name.</p>

<p>That one at least of the officers did was proved
presently when Ensign Stowell turned from listening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
to Cochran’s lecture on the mechanism of the
bow gun delivered to “Spuds,” Hanson, radio
man, and Jaynes, chief machinist, and stopped in
the lee of the deck-house where “Chatty” was
leaning against the life-buoy that hung there and
gazing thoughtfully across the sun-flecked water
to the distant green expanse of Nantucket.</p>

<p>“Well, Troy,” said the Ensign, “seen any periscopes
yet?”</p>

<p>Sighting a periscope was an over-used joke in
the patrol service those days, but it usually
brought a smile, just as it did now.</p>

<p>“Not yet, sir. I’d like to.”</p>

<p>The officer laughed. “By Jove, so would I!
But I guess you and I’ll have to cross the briny
before we have any such luck as that. You came
from the Newport Station, didn’t you? What do
they say there about getting across? The Reserves,
I mean.”</p>

<p>“A good many have gone, sir. There was a
detail of seventy left the day I did. They were
to go to Halifax and board a transport for the
other side. Nothing was known beyond that,
but the general idea was that they were to be
sprinkled around the destroyers over there.”</p>

<p>The officer sighed. “I’ve done my best to
make it, but this is what I drew. Oh, well, something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
may happen even here. You know the
<i>Smith’s</i> men stick to it that they dodged a torpedo
off the Maine coast the other day.”</p>

<p>The boy smiled again, and the Ensign, watching,
chuckled. “Just my idea,” he agreed, although
the other hadn’t spoken. “Still, it would
be something to even <em>think</em> you saw a ‘fish,’ eh?
There’d be a dime’s worth of excitement in that!
How did you happen to go into the Reserves,
Troy?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to get into action, sir, and the folks
I talked with thought I’d get there quicker if I
enlisted in the Reserves than in the Navy. I’m
not so sure now, though. Maybe I made a mistake.”
The <i>Wanderer</i> called gruffly twice to a
tug ahead and the tug unhurriedly replied. Ensign
Stowell spoke to the man at the wheel,
through the open door of the house, and turned
back again.</p>

<p>“Blessed if I can tell you,” he answered.
“Looks to me, though, as if they were going to
need every man they can get before this shindy is
over. Well I hope they’ll shove me over before
long! I didn’t count on serving in a two-by-twice
motor boat. Have you been to sea much?”</p>

<p>“I made two trips on a sailing vessel, sir, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
my father. The last time was in the Fall. The
Germans got her.”</p>

<p>“Got her! You mean sank her? Where was
this? What ship was she?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Jonas Clinton</i>, sir. We were shelled
about five hundred miles from the coast on the
voyage back.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Clinton</i>! Of course, I remember that!
So you were the captain’s son that was picked up
by a British destroyer, eh? I remember reading
about it. That was in November, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“October, sir: the sixteenth when we were
picked up. They got the schooner about midnight
of the fourteenth.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, they found four of you in a small
boat——”</p>

<p>“Five, sir, and a dog.”</p>

<p>“Was it five? I remember about the dog.
The papers made a sort of hero of you, didn’t
they? Had you risking your life to get the dog
off, or something.”</p>

<p>“The papers,” replied Nelson Troy gravely,
“printed a good deal that wasn’t so. I couldn’t
very well leave Pickles behind, you see. And
I guess there wasn’t much danger.”</p>

<p>“But, I say, Troy, your father!” The ensign’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
voiced dropped sympathetically. “He was
lost, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I rattled on so about it! I’d forgotten
that. By Jove, I don’t blame you for
wanting to get a whack at those murderers! You
had a hard time, boy. Was your father killed
outright?”</p>

<p>Nelson’s eyes closed slightly and two vertical
creases appeared above his straight nose. “I
don’t think so, sir. You see, they couldn’t find
him. Mr. Cupples, the mate, thought he might
have been forward when the first shell struck
and been knocked overboard. And I suppose
that’s the way it was, but dad was a good swimmer,
and unless he was wounded first I don’t
see why we didn’t find him. That shell cleaned
out the forecastle and killed five of the crew,
but it couldn’t have hit anyone on deck, as I figure
it. Dad might have been standing square over
where the shell burst, perhaps. It’s a sort of
a mystery, sir, and I don’t know what to think,
only—somehow—I can’t make up my mind that
he’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” replied the other thoughtfully.
“It’s just as well to keep on hoping. He may turn
up some day. Still, there’s this to consider, Troy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
If he was knocked into the sea and was picked
up you would have heard from him long before
this.”</p>

<p>“Unless he was picked up by the U-boat that
attacked us,” answered the boy quietly.</p>

<p>“By the U-boat? Why, yes, that’s possible,
of course. Do you know whether she searched
the schooner before she sank her?”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t be sure, sir. She didn’t show
any lights, of course, but it was sort of half
moonlight, and after we’d rowed off about two
miles we thought we saw something approach the
schooner. We didn’t stay around long, because
we were afraid they would see us and start shelling.”</p>

<p>“I see. But you stood by the ship long enough
to have rescued your father if he had been afloat,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we rowed around for about fifteen
minutes. Then the shells were getting pretty
thick and the sailors wouldn’t stay any longer
so we rowed out of range. That’s what I don’t
understand. If dad wasn’t on board, and Mr.
Cupples says they searched all over for him, he
must have been in the water. But we couldn’t
find him there, and——” The boy’s voice trailed
into silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>The ensign laid a sympathetic hand on his
shoulder. “He might have been there, just the
same,” he said hopefully. “Stranger things have
happened. I don’t suppose he was wearing a
life-belt.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, none of us were. We didn’t really
expect any trouble, although dad had his mind
on it that night. I remember his saying he’d be
easier when we were out of the submarine zone.
But I no more expected what happened than—than
nothing at all!”</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t! Who would? Oh,
wait till we get a shot at them! We’ve got a lot
of scores to pay off, Troy, and, by the Great
Horned Spoon, we’ll do it! Now I understand
why you’re so eager for service, Troy, and I
hope you’ll soon get across where things are
happening. I know that we’re taught that revenge
is sinful, but——”</p>

<p>The ensign shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is exactly revenge I want,”
replied Nelson thoughtfully. “Killing a thousand
Germans wouldn’t bring dad back, if he’s really—gone,
but things like that aren’t right, sir, and I’d
like to do my share in stopping them. No nation
should be allowed to act like a pirate, to attack
neutral ships on the high seas and murder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
defenseless men. But of course you can’t teach
nations of that sort by just talking to them; you’ve
got to hurt them first. That, as I figure it, is
why we’ve gone into this war, sir. Anyway,
I guess it’s why I’ve gone into it.”</p>

<p>“Right! ‘For the Freedom of the Seas!’
That’s our motto, and before we’re done we’ll
write it big over every ocean, Troy. And across
the sky we’ll write ‘Humanity!’” The ensign
ceased abruptly, smiled as though at his own earnestness,
and nodded. “Good luck, Troy. You’ve
got the right idea, son.”</p>

<p>He passed aft and disappeared down the companion
that led to the officers’ quarters, leaving
Nelson again to his thoughts. But after a moment
he shook them off, left the lee of the bridge
and went forward. Cross Rip Light Ship was
nearly abeam now and Martha’s Vineyard was
coming fast across the flashing water. Staples,
seaman gunner, was lavishing good vaseline on
the bow gun and singing a song as he worked.
He broke off at Nelson’s approach and nodded
gayly.</p>

<p>“Think I’ll ever have a chance to point this
little toy, Chatty?” he asked. “Say, wouldn’t
it surprise those chaps on the light ship to drop a
shell alongside? I’d like to do it just to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
’em jump! What’s on the luff’s mind today, do
you think?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Nelson. “We’re making
for New Bedford, though. There was a lot
of sizzling in the radio room an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Maybe someone saw a porpoise,” hazarded
Staples. “And this is what I left a happy home
for! Well, it’s a fine, free life, with nothing to
do but work. There, if anyone finds any rust on
that gun it won’t be my fault. Isn’t it most time
for grub?”</p>

<p>“Pretty near, but I guess they’ll wait till we’re
at anchor.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! What’s the big idea? Don’t
they know I’m hungrier than a shark? Anchored
be blowed! Why, that’ll be the middle of the
afternoon!”</p>

<p>“Not at this rate, Lanky. We’re doing twenty
and New Bedford’s only about thirty-five miles.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, and it’s seven bells now,” replied
Staples disconsolately. “Some folks haven’t any
heart at all. I’m so near starved I could eat
that grease!”</p>

<p>“I guess that would fetch about five dollars
in Germany,” said Nelson, “if what we hear
is so. They’d probably butter their bread with
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a sight better spread than they deserve,”
grunted the gunner. “Axle grease is what those
criminals ought to have. Help me with this
jacket, will you?”</p>

<p>Nelson lent a hand and the canvas covering
was drawn back over the gun and laced tight.
Staples wiped his hands thoughtfully on a bunch
of waste. “Know what I’d rather have happen
than a plate of beans and a quart of coffee,
Chatty?” he asked, gazing westward over the
plunging bow. Nelson didn’t and said so. “Well,
I’d rather see a U-boat come up right over where
that gull’s dipping. That’s my rather.”</p>

<p>“You’re likely to see it,” laughed Nelson.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I?” demanded the other.
“What’s the use of us fellers kiting around here
if there’s never going to be any fun? Mark my
words, Chatty, some day you’re going to be surprised.
Government isn’t paying us wages to
give us sea trips. Not by a long shot! We’re
here because we’re needed here. It’s Lanky
Staples that’s telling you!”</p>

<small>THE LONELY REEF</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The <i>Wanderer</i> slid into New Bedford
shortly after one o’clock, fluttered a
greeting to the torpedo boat <i>Hollis</i>,
lying off Fort Point, and dropped anchor in the
inner harbor. There was liberty when dinner was
over, and Nelson and a half-dozen others spent
the afternoon exploring the streets of the old
whaling town. The <i>Wanderer</i> replenished fuel
tanks and stole out again shortly after dusk, just
as the lights were appearing along shore. A
group of Jackies on the after deck of the <i>Hollis</i>
cheered and shouted raillery as the little patrol
sped past so close one could have counted the
chevrons of their rating badges. Billy Masters,
apprentice seaman, stopped by the forecastle
break, where Nelson was on lookout duty, and
jerked his head in the direction of the receding
torpedo boat.</p>

<p>“I suppose those fellows think a lot of themselves
because they’re on a regular boat, eh?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Bet you anything you like, Chatty, we have a lot
more fun than they do.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder,” answered Nelson. “What’s
that thing bucking along there? Looks like a
mine-layer, doesn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What do you suppose she was before
they patched her up and painted her gray? Looks
like a little old tub that used to run excursions
on the river when I was a kid back home.”</p>

<p>“Where was that, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Portsmouth, Ohio. Ever there?” Nelson
shook his head while his gaze followed the little
blunt-nosed, high-decked steamer that came wallowing
toward them from the open sea. Billy
Masters sighed. “It’s a swell little burg, and I
wish I was back there,” he murmured. Then, as
the <i>Wanderer’s</i> search light, atop the wheel-house,
jumped into life and sent a long inquiring path
across the darkening water, he added more cheerfully:
“If I was, though, I’d want to be back here
again, so what’s the use?”</p>

<p>The approaching craft bellowed once hoarsely
and the <i>Wanderer</i> replied. “Sounds like she had
a sore throat,” muttered Billy. “Say, what’s up
tonight?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the skipper’s sort of excited like and so’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the other. And Spuds says the <i>Hollis’s</i> captain
was aboard this afternoon and he and our skipper
and the junior were chinning for about an hour
down there. And Ole’s wearing a sort of wise
look on his ugly Swedish mug like he knew a lot
more’n he wanted to say. Let me tell you something.
I don’t believe Ole can hear a blamed
thing on that wireless of his. He just puts that
black thing around his head and frowns and writes
on pieces of paper. Then he takes ’em in to the
skipper and the skipper, being in the plot, nods
his old head and opens a little book and makes
believe to decode the silly stuff. Why, it stands
to reason that an aerial no bigger’n a back-yard
clothes line can’t pick up much!”</p>

<p>Nelson laughed. “You tell that to Ole. He’ll
drop you overboard.”</p>

<p>“Huh, I ain’t afraid of any tow-headed galoot
like him, even if he did go to school for three
months and has doodaddies on his sleeve. I could
have been a radio man if I’d wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“’Cause when there’s something doing I want
to be in it. No sitting around on a stool for mine,
getting my head knocked off and jabbing out,
‘Shell has just entered radio room, killing operator.
Good bye!’ That may be heroic and get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
your picture in the paper, but it don’t get you
much else!”</p>

<p>The <i>Wanderer</i> left Dumpling Rock Light on
her starboard and swung her bow more to the
west. By nine o’clock, down in the “forecastle,”
they were predicting a visit to New York or
Brooklyn, and Perry, first-class shipfitter, was
licking his lips in anticipation.</p>

<p>“I’ve got friends down there,” he said, half
closing his eyes and swaying ecstatically back and
forth on the edge of a bunk in time to the rocking
of the boat. “They’ll ask me to dinner. There’ll
be chicken, like as not, and lots of pie. Maybe
two or three kinds of pie.” He looked around
to see how the announcement affected the others
and was disappointed. “Maybe lemon pie with
suds atop,” he added desperately.</p>

<p>Lanky Staples grunted. “You can have all the
pie you want,” he said. “Me for a real feed on
Broadway. I know the place, too. A stack of
wheats as high as that——” He held his hands
some fourteen inches apart—“and about a pint
of maple syrup, and two or three cups of real
coffee, not the stuff Spuds gives us——”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know the place, too,” interrupted
the cook sarcastically. “You get a couple of flies
in the syrup an’ they don’t charge you a cent for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
’em! You wouldn’t know good coffee from a
cup of bilge water, you long-legged giraffe!”</p>

<p>“Think we’ll get liberty?” asked Endicott
longingly. “I got folks out to Flatbush.”</p>

<p>“We won’t get that much liberty,” replied
Lanky, gently. “Maybe we’ll get a day. Why
don’t you telegraph your folks to come half-way
and meet you?”</p>

<p>Their dreams of the gayety of New York were
doomed, however, to a sad awakening. When
the morning watch went on at four the <i>Wanderer</i>
was swinging at anchor in a choppy sea with
nothing in sight in the gray darkness but a stretch
of ghostly breakers a half-mile to the west. As
the light grew a beach became visible beyond
the surf and, finally, a low island stretched before
them. Nelson, coming on deck at eight, viewed
it curiously. It appeared to be about a half-mile
long and, he guessed, scarcely more than a quarter
of that in width. At no place did it rise more
than ten feet above the ocean. In the gray, cold
light of a cloudy day it was about as desolate and
lonely a spot as one could imagine. Not even
a hut broke the monotony of the sky-line, but
at the farther end a cluster of low, wind-tossed,
misshapen trees made a darker blot on the expanse
of sand and beach grass. There were low<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
bushes here and there; bayberry, probably, and
sweet-gale; and in one place, not far from the
<i>Wanderer’s</i> unquiet anchorage, a ledge cropped
a few feet above the sand. Gulls fluttered over
the island, but they constituted the only signs
of life.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, Chatty?” asked
Cochran, gunner’s mate, ranging alongside. Nelson
shook his head. “Doesn’t look as if we’d
come all this way to picnic on the beach, does
it?” He looked around in all directions. “Where
are we? That’s what I’d like to know. We’ve
been pretty well over these waters for a week
or so, but I’ll swear to goodness I never saw that
cheerful looking reef before.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Nelson. “It must be one of the
Elizabeths, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“No, I know the whole bunch: Nonamesset,
Uncatena, Naushon, Pasque and Nashawena,
Cuttyhunk and Penikese. Sounds like something
out of Longfellow, don’t it? ‘Hiawatha,’ maybe.
No, we’re further from New Bedford than any
of those. We didn’t drop anchor until about
four bells, and we were doing fourteen most of
the time. There’s some sand banks like that—”
he nodded at the desolate expanse before them—“south
of the Vineyard, I’ve heard. They get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
down on the charts as reefs and then the sea
kicks a lot of sand over them and they’re islands.
And maybe ten years after that they’re just rocks
again. A couple of good gales tears them all to
pieces. This one looks as if it had been here
quite a spell, though.” Cochran broke the wrapper
of a package of chewing gum, proffered it to
Nelson and stowed a piece between his teeth.
“Anyway,” he went on when he had got the gum
working nicely, “you can be sure of one thing,
Chatty. We didn’t come down here and slop
around half the night in this nasty chop without
some reason. Maybe that island’s one of these
German submarine bases you read about.”</p>

<p>Nelson smiled. “They might have chosen a
more cheerful one, I’d say. We’ll find out pretty
quick, I guess, for there’s the Old Man now.”</p>

<p>But the solution of the mystery was not due
to be solved just yet. Lieutenant Hattuck, very
erect and smart in his uniform, walked forward
to the bridge. Then he and the junior made
their way to the bow and, standing by the gray-jacketed
gun, examined the shore through their
glasses and talked together for several minutes.
Green, Ole Hanson’s relief, climbed out of the
wireless room and approached them with a fluttering
wisp of paper in his hand. Action followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
closely after the captain had cast his eye over the
message and handed it to the ensign. Up came
the anchor and the <i>Wanderer</i> crept slowly along
the shore, the ensign himself at the wheel, and
Quartermaster’s Mate Jones keeping an anxious
watch at the bow. When nearly opposite the
easternmost end of the island, which curved
slightly to the south, the small boat was ordered
lowered and Mr. Stowell, yielding the wheel, gave
his orders.</p>

<p>“Jones, pick four men for a landing party.
Arm with automatics.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Do I go along?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Hustle now.”</p>

<p>“Right, sir! Staples, Troy, Endicott and Masters!
Get a jump on! Don’t forget your cartridge
belts!”</p>

<p>Four minutes later they were in the little boat,
her tiny engine sending her bobbing crazily over
the gray-green water. Ensign Stowell was in
the stern sheets and Jones brooded over the engine.
They beached near the little forest of
twisted trees, leaped into the shallow surf and
carried the anchor ashore.</p>

<p>“Draw your bean-shooters,” directed the officer,
“but keep the safety on. Come ahead, keep
down pretty well and don’t talk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>It was the matter of eighty or a hundred yards
to where the straggling trees began. They
climbed quietly up the sloping beach, the ensign
leading, and paused where the high tides of winter
had left a ridge of sand, loosely clad with
grass and wild pea. Before them there lay the
wind-rippled surface of the island, flat and unbroken
save for the patch of trees, and beyond,
the sea again. Nelson thought he could discern
what looked like land where the horizon lay, but
could not be certain. What he was certain of was
a tiny dark speck that bobbed about some two
miles away to the north and could be nothing else
than a boat. Mr. Stowell gave a grunt and pulled
his glasses from their case and leveled them.
After a long moment he returned them, faced the
<i>Wanderer</i>, circling slowly about off the beach, and
waved an arm semaphore fashion. The captain,
watching from the deck, waved an answer. A
minute later, with her engines humming, she was
standing straight out to sea.</p>

<p>The officer led the way again, bearing to the
right until they were well hidden from the approaching
boat by the trees. Then they went
forward and gained the edge of the tiny forest
and, following the example set by the ensign,
threw themselves down on the sand amidst the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
crackling branches of bayberry bushes to which
a few sere leaves and odorous gray berries still
clung. The dwarfed trees ahead were pitch pine,
although here and there a leafless wild cherry was
struggling for existence. Ensign Stowell conversed
in low tones with the quartermaster’s mate
and alternately peered through a vista in the
grove at the coming boat and cast roving glances
about the trees, much, thought Nelson, as though
he were looking for birds’ nests!</p>

<p>“What’s the game, Chatty?” muttered Endicott,
pulling himself nearer. “German spies?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know. Tell you later.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged. I say, look where the <i>Wanderer</i>
is!”</p>

<p>Nelson looked. The patrol boat was a good
three miles south and was now running eastward
at half-speed, presenting a fine imitation of a person
minding his own business. Evidently, concluded
Nelson, the plan was to keep out of sight
until the persons in the small motor boat—for
that was what the craft now showed itself to be—had
landed. Then, doubtless, the <i>Wanderer</i>
would turn back. But he was still puzzled, for
the patrol boat could, naturally, run rings about
the smaller one or, if it pleased her, blow her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
clean out of the water. There was, then, evidently
more to the operation than just capture.</p>

<p>The approaching motor boat was making slow
work of it, and hard, for the sea was decidedly
rough today for such small craft; but she came
pluckily on, bobbing about like a cork and, doubtless,
shipping water with every toss. They could
see her occupants now, three men at least, and
possibly four. The smoke from the exhaust left
a trail of lighter gray against the gray of sea and
sky. Masters was examining his automatic with
a nonchalance that didn’t deceive anyone.</p>

<p>The motor boat made straight for the beach
on the north side of the island, which today was
also the lee side. Nelson could see her no longer
now, but he heard Ensign Stowell say softly to
Jones: “Four of them. They’re all there, then.”</p>

<p>Even when the boat had grounded and her
crew had sprung up to their knees in water and
waded ashore with the painter they were too far
off for their features to be distinguished. Nelson
squirmed a bit to the right and found a place
from which he could watch. The quartette pushed
an anchor into the sand well above the tide, and
Nelson saw that a second one had been dropped
from her stern. The boat was surprisingly tiny
for such a sea and he was forced to credit the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
unknown crew with a good deal of courage. They
were coming up the rise of the further beach
now, one carrying a square wooden box that
looked heavy as it bumped against his leg at each
stride. They walked in single file, the man with
the box bringing up the rear. The leader was
not tall, but there was something authoritative in
the way he carried his squarely-built figure. In
spite of the black rain-coat which shrouded him
he looked military. The others, similarly protected
from the weather and the sea, were distinctly
civilian.</p>

<p>Just as they left the beach and gained the higher
level of the island the leader stopped abruptly
and pointed to the eastward. Nelson, following
the direction of his hand, descried the <i>Wanderer</i>,
running northward now, almost an indistinguishable
gray object against the sea. After a
minute the four men came on, walking a little
more hurriedly, and entered the wood on the
further side. For a moment or two they were visible
between the trees, and then they disappeared
as suddenly as though the earth had swallowed
them!</p>

<p>Jones turned and looked inquiringly at Ensign
Stowell, but the latter shook his head.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he said softly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<small>A BATTLE UNDERGROUND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Five minutes passed; ten. The <i>Wanderer</i>
was out of sight now beyond the trees.
Ensign Stowell beckoned and his little
command drew closer.</p>

<p>“We want those chaps,” he said in low tones.
“They’ve got a hiding place of some sort over
there; probably a hut. There are six of us. Have
you all got watches?”</p>

<p>Everyone nodded.</p>

<p>“Good. I’ll go around to the further side,
Jones will take the next post on the west, then
Endicott. You stay here, Masters. Staples you
will cut around to the east and Troy will go half-way.
Five minutes by your watches from the
time I start off you will all close in. Don’t fire
a shot until I give the word unless you are fired
on. Then shoot to stop your man but not kill
him. Make as little noise as you can, watch for
your friends and don’t mistake them for the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
we’re after. Get it, all of you? All right. Look
at your watches.”</p>

<p>The ensign rose and started eastward around
the edge of the straggling grove. Jones followed,
and Staples. After a minute or so Endicott and
Nelson quietly went their separate ways, leaving
a somewhat anxious looking youth behind in the
shape of Billy Masters. Nelson kept to the sand
so that his feet would tread on no crackling twigs,
and, when he had traversed what he believed to
be the proper distance, knelt and looked at the
watch on the leather strap about his wrist. He
had still two and a half minutes to wait. From
his place he could see the <i>Wanderer</i> again. She
was swinging westward now, perhaps two miles
away, but one who didn’t know would never have
suspected her of interest in this forlorn stretch
of reef and sand. Nelson thought he could make
out a moving figure on her forecastle deck and
wondered if it was Cochran impatiently awaiting
a chance to ram a cartridge into that bow gun.
Save for the roar of the waves and the plaintive
cries of the gulls everything was still. The seconds
ticked themselves slowly away. A minute
more now to wait. A half minute—fifteen seconds—ten—five——</p>

<p>He arose, revolver in hand, and stepped forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
into the gloom of the pines. In spite of
his care a twig snapped occasionally under his
feet as, dodging queer, misshapen branches, he
went on toward the center of the wood. The sand
was soft and mixed with pine needles and clothed
here and there with sad-looking vines already
showing new leaves. The trees were more
scattered than he had thought, and were twisted
strangely by the force of the gales. After a minute
he caught sight of something moving ahead
of him and, with a leap of his heart, swung his
automatic up. But it was Endicott. A second
rustling brought Masters to view. Converging,
they kept on. One by one the other members of
the landing party drew near, Staples last of all.
The ensign was clearly nonplused. He looked
enquiringly from face to face. Each man shook
his head. They stood in silence for a minute.
The sound of the surf was strangely hushed here
in the center of the little wood. Nelson could
hear his watch tick. The ensign was looking toward
the tops of the small trees, pivoting slowly
on his heel. Jones was doing the same. Nelson,
suspecting an airplane, looked, too, but saw nothing
except the gray sky through the loose branches.
The ensign raised a hand warningly and stepped
a dozen paces to the eastward and repeated his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
queer survey, and then to the north. The others
watched and waited in silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly they saw the ensign’s roving gaze fix
itself steadily on some point almost above his head.
They craned their necks, but saw nothing. The
ensign’s head moved again and finally he walked
away from them, step by step, still gazing upward.
Nelson, for one, was fairly consumed by
curiosity and would have remained so several
moments longer had not his wandering gaze surprised
Lanky Staples in the act of forming the
word “wireless” with his lips. Then Nelson
understood and peered eagerly into the topmost
branches and, after an instant, saw what the officer
had seen. Once detected the apparatus was
startlingly evident. Twenty paces away from
where Nelson stood, a twenty-foot sapling had
been lashed to one of the taller trees. Some forty
feet away another sapling, not quite so long, had
been secured. Between them, invisible to a careless
gaze, stretched two fine copper wires, perhaps
two feet apart. From above they might
have been detected, but from any point seaward
they were invisible.</p>

<p>The ensign was stepping softly back toward
the little group, a quiet smile on his lean face.
“We’ve got them,” he whispered. He bent a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
thumb over a shoulder. “They’ve dug a hole
back there. See that darkest pine, the one with
the branches low to the ground? There’s a trap-door
there. You stay here until I beckon. I
want to make sure that it’s unlocked. When I
beckon, come quietly, but keep out of range, for
they may start popping.”</p>

<p>The ensign crept slowly off toward the indicated
spot and presently they saw him stoop. A
second later he straightened again and beckoned.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Jones softly.</p>

<p>They joined the ensign. Half hidden by the
drooping branches of the tree, and raised a bare
inch above the sandy floor of the forest, was a
square of wood, some eighteen inches across, of
matched boards painted gray and sprinkled with
sand while still wet. The ensign pointed to a
barely defined path that led toward the northern
beach and looked accusingly at Jones, and Jones,
observing, shook his head sadly and stuck out a
dubious lower lip. But there was no opportunity
for excuses, had he had any to offer, for the ensign
noiselessly raised the trap, revealing a ladder
which, at first startled glance, seemed to lead far
into the bowels of the earth. At the foot of it
was a glow of light. As their eyes grew accustomed
to the gloom of the narrow shaft, revetted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
carefully with planking, they saw that the bottom
was after all but a dozen or fourteen feet
below them. And, as they looked they heard
plainly the crackling of a wireless and the low
sound of voices.</p>

<p>Ensign Stowell studied the situation a moment
and then he leaned toward Jones and they spoke
together softly. Jones passed on the orders.
“Lanky, you come next. Then Chatty, then you,
Endy. You stay up here, Billy, and watch. If
any of them come up the ladder, drop ’em. All
right, sir!”</p>

<p>The ensign slipped back the safety catch of
his automatic and noiselessly lowered himself into
the aperture. Jones, revolver ready, watched
anxiously. Rung by rung the ensign descended.
When his head had disappeared Jones followed.
Those above, listening with painful intentness,
heard scarcely a sound from the shaft. Staples
scowled impatiently. Then he, too, set foot on
the ladder, and at that instant they heard the
ensign drop the last six feet and heard his voice
cry:</p>

<p>“<em><a href="#i_frontis">Hands up!</a></em>”</p>

<p>Jones was gone now, Staples was descending
rapidly and Nelson was following. The gray
daylight disappeared as the latter feverishly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
searched for the rungs with impatient feet. From
below came a dim yellow radiance. He heard the
sharp report of a revolver, voices, the thud of
Staples’ body as he spurned the last rungs of the
ladder. He looked down. Jones was flattened
against the wall, but he cried a warning and
dropped.</p>

<p>He landed on his feet, collided with Jones and
sprawled sideways. Another shot rang out and
he was conscious of a blow on his arm under
the shoulder and of Jones leaping across him.
Then he struggled to his feet. Smoke wreathed
and eddied in the dim light of a single lamp that
hung from a nail in one corner, and made a haze
through which he saw dimly. One of the enemy
lay prone on the earth floor with blood trickling
from his head. A second, a smoking pistol still
in his grasp, stood with his hands above him.
A third, surprised at the instrument, the receiver
still in place was slewed half-way around on the
box that served for chair and with drooping jaw
and frightened eyes raised his hands, too, in token
of surrender while his furtive glances swept the
room for an avenue of escape. But the fourth
and last member of the quartet was still unsubdued.
It was he who had fired the last shot,
and, although his revolver now lay on the ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
under trampling feet, he fought fiercely, desperately
in the clutch of Jones, uttering all the
while the guttural, savage growls of an animal.
Back and forth they swayed, lurched against the
man on the box, who cringed away from them,
stumbled back to the center of the floor again.
The ensign and Staples, their revolvers covering
the others, watched the struggle for an instant.
Then, just as Endicott joined them, Jones thrust
a leg behind his adversary and sent him sprawling
heavily. He was on him in the instant, astride
his chest, pinioning his arms to the floor and the
encounter was over. “Take that man’s revolver,
Troy,” directed the ensign.</p>

<p>Nelson stepped across the prostrate enemy on
the floor and approached the man who was standing.
As he did so he tried to return his own
weapon to its holster but found to his surprise
and dismay that he could not raise it from where
it hung at his side. So he used his left hand
instead and took the revolver from the upstretched
hand of the captive.</p>

<p>“Search him,” said the ensign, and Nelson,
giving the revolver to Endicott, went over him
without finding any other weapon.</p>

<p>“Stand over there against the wall,” commanded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
the officer, “and keep your hands well
up. Now, you on the box, stand up.”</p>

<p>The wireless operator had difficulty in obeying
because his legs were not inclined to hold him,
but Endicott helped him, more forcibly than politely,
and he too was searched, without result,
and sent to join his companion. By that time
Jones’ adversary was quiet and he was allowed to
get up.</p>

<p>“Back to the wall there, please,” said the ensign.
“Jones, you and Staples watch those men.
If they lower their hands an inch, shoot.” He
stooped over the man who lay unconscious from
a blow with the butt of a revolver and examined
the wound. “He will come around in a few
minutes,” he said. “See any water here, Troy?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“He will have to wait then. Now let’s see
what’s here.”</p>

<p>He went to the bench on which were the wireless
instruments and papers and gave his attention
to the latter. Nelson, conscious of a dull pain
in his right arm, returned his revolver to the
holster with his left hand and then looked curiously
around him.</p>

<p>The subterranean apartment was much larger
than he had expected to see, being fully five paces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
long by four wide. The walls and floor were
of hard-packed sand, the roof of heavy timbers
supported by posts of unpeeled cedar set at intervals
along the walls. Although the floor must
have been a full two feet below the ocean level
it was scarcely more than moist. Three narrow
two-inch boards ran from wall to wall at the
end of the chamber opposite the ladder and served
to hold the instruments of the wireless outfit:
battery, jars, coils, detector, spark gap, condenser,
switches and key. The discarded receiver swung
over the edge from its cords. As was discovered
later, the wires to the aerial were led along the
roof and up a corner of the shaft. At the right
of the bench a green tin lamp was supported by
a nail driven in a post. There was no furniture
except the empty box that had done duty as a
chair. Some nails in the supporting posts held the
coats and hats of the four conspirators. A box
of safety matches had been spilled and its contents
lay scattered on the ground.</p>

<p>Nelson had no difficulty in picking out the
leader of the four, the one whose bearing at a
distance had stamped him as military. It was he
who had fought so desperately with Jones and
who now, somewhat the worse for the encounter,
stood straight against the wall, hands upheld and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
a sneering and haughty smile on his good-looking
face. As Nelson observed him he spoke to
the ensign.</p>

<p>“What you find there will be of no use to you,”
he said. “If you seek to prove us guilty of anything
unlawful, sir, you are doomed to disappointment.”
He spoke in very precise English which
might well have deceived his hearer until the
latter had viewed the typically German countenance
with its rather small gray eyes under heavy
brows, its somewhat aquiline nose, high cheeks,
carefully waxed mustaches and general expression
of arrogance.</p>

<p>“We will let others decide that,” replied the
ensign coldly. He bundled the few papers and
a small black leatherette-covered book together
and placed them with care in the inner pocket of
his jacket. Then: “Place these instruments, as
many as you can, back in this box, Troy,” he directed.
“Hello, what’s the matter with your
arm?”</p>

<p>“I think a bullet got me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Let me see. I should say so! Get his sleeve
out of the way, Endicott. Better cut it. That’s
it.” He made a tourniquet above the wound
from which the blood was running freely. “You
go on up, lad. Call Masters down to help you.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
He turned then to the prisoners. “You will march
to the ladder, one at a time, and wait outside.
There is no use trying to escape, for a patrol
boat is lying off the beach. Besides, you will be
shot instantly the moment you make a break.
Lieutenant Haegel, you first, please.”</p>

<p>The man started at the sound of his name and
two white disks appeared at his cheek-bones. But
he bowed, smiled ironically and asked: “I may
lower my hands, I presume?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Go first, Staples. Now, then——”</p>

<p>Outside, Nelson, suddenly feeling faint, sat on
the sand and tried to keep the trees from swaying.
He saw Staples emerge, and then the German addressed
as Lieutenant Haegel, but no others, for
just then he toppled quietly over on the ground.</p>

<small>A CHANCE ENCOUNTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Many of the subsequent details Nelson
failed to see, for he was put aboard
the <i>Wanderer</i> and consigned to his
bunk, after which Sawyer, machinist’s mate and
the nearest thing to a surgeon that the boat
boasted, made a fairly neat job of cleansing and
bandaging the wound.</p>

<p>“The bullet’s in there yet, Chatty,” he said with
what sounded like professional satisfaction. “I
can feel it and——”</p>

<p>“Ouch! So can I!” affirmed Nelson.</p>

<p>“Sure! But a doc will have it out in no time.
If it hasn’t bust the bone you’ll be lucky, though.”
With which cheering observation Sawyer went his
way and Nelson laid there and ruefully considered
his luck and tried to picture, through the
evidence of his ears, what was going on “topside.”</p>

<p>Half an hour after the surprise party in the
cave, the four prisoners were safely aboard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Cochran with much gusto had put a three-inch
shell through their motor boat and the <i>Wanderer</i>
was hiking back to New Bedford. There
was a conversation between the captain and Lieutenant
Haegel in the after cabin on the way back,
attended by Ensign Stowell, but what was said no
one else aboard ever knew. Nelson’s personal
interest in the affairs of the four conspirators
ended soon after he had worried down a small portion
of diluted broth, for he went to sleep and
slept until the <i>Wanderer</i> reached port. It was
the rattling of the winch that aroused him. Presently
Ensign Stowell entered.</p>

<p>“How’s the arm, Troy?” he enquired. “I was
down here an hour ago, but you were sleeping.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t hurt, sir,” replied Nelson, not very
truthfully.</p>

<p>“Good! I’m going to send you up to the hospital
and have that bullet out. You’d better
stay there a few days. No use trying to use your
arm until the stiffness has gone. When they discharge
you, report back on board. We’ll be glad
to see you again. I’ll send one of the men to help
you dress. Good luck, Troy.”</p>

<p>It was Billy Masters who appeared to act the
rôle of valet, but Billy divided between resentment
at being kept out of the underground fracas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and elation over the successful outcome of the
<i>Wanderer’s</i> first engagement with the enemy. He
expressed no sympathy for Nelson, but on the
contrary regarded him with envy. While he
handed Nelson his clothes and helped him to get
into them he rattled on with his news.</p>

<p>“Some haul that was, Chatty, believe me. This
fellow with the waxed mustache is a German army
officer. He’s been living over at a place called
Oak Bluffs on Martha’s Vineyard pretending his
name was Schmitt or something. Made believe
he was an American citizen and said he was writing
a book about the island and its history and
all that. The others don’t amount to much.
One’s a German named Anhalt and another’s a
sort of Russian; I forget what sort. The fellow
who did the telegraphing is a poor mutt they
picked up in Canada. Guess he hasn’t got any
nationality. Seems the Secret Service has been
after this Haegel guy for months but couldn’t
find him. They knew he was in the country,
though, and suspected he’d be mixed up in some
wireless stunt. A couple of days ago the Canadian—if
that’s what he is, which I don’t believe,
because he don’t look like any Canadian I ever
saw—goes into a drug store in New Bedford and
gets a prescription filled. He had to wait awhile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
for it, you see, and while he was waiting he leans
on the counter and does like this, see? Like he
was working a telegraph key. Well, the drug
fellow was one of these wireless fiends before the
government put ’em out of business and he listened
to what the guy was tapping out. First
he says, ‘Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up’! like that,
over and over. Then he says a lot of figures that
don’t mean anything to the drug fellow, and after
that some more nonsense. And he gets his medicine
and goes out. But the drug fellow gets to
thinking about him. He’s seen the guy around for
about a month and he don’t ever seem to have
anything special to do. So that evening he goes
and tells his story to a fellow he knows who’s
some sort of a United States attorney or something.
The attorney hands it along to the Secret
Service sleuths who’ve been snooping around looking
for a wireless station somewhere on the Cape,
do you see? After that it was easy. They find
out where this poor guy lives and watch him
and they see this Anhalt fellow come sneaking
around at night and they hears ’em make a date
for this morning at four o’clock and hears ’em
speak of that island back there. The <i>Hollis</i> got
the job first, but she had another date up the
coast and so hands it over to us. What this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Haegel fellow was doing was getting news of
sailings from American ports from some pal in
New York or somewhere by mail and then going
over to that island and sending it by wireless to
Swedish and Norwegian ships out to sea. All
they had to do was pass it on when they got near
enough the other side. Easy, eh? Don’t you say
anything about it, for no one’s supposed to know.”</p>

<p>“Where did you hear it?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>Billy blinked and hesitated. Finally: “Well,
I was leaning over the rail aft last night after we
left New Bedford and the cap and the junior was
talking it over in the cabin and it sort of floated
out!”</p>

<p>“You made believe you didn’t know anything
about it!” charged Nelson. Billy Masters
grinned.</p>

<p>“Sure! A fellow don’t repeat what he ain’t
supposed to know, does he?”</p>

<p>“What are you doing now?” Nelson laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, it don’t matter now. It’s all over. Gee,
you’re a lucky guy, Chatty. You get swell grub
in the hospitals!”</p>

<p>After a week of it, however, Nelson didn’t
agree with Billy. But a minor surgical case such
as he was is not likely to find hospital food quite
satisfying. After the first two days Nelson’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
normally healthy appetite returned in its full vigor
and more than once he would gladly have exchanged
his rations for the solid “chow” of the
<i>Wanderer’s</i> forecastle. The bullet had slightly
splintered the bone of the upper arm. The doctor
called it the “humerus,” a name for it which
Nelson entirely disapproved of. Two weeks was
the period of convalescence, in any case, and for
a full fortnight Nelson mooned around the hospital
and the town. During that time the <i>Wanderer</i>
came into port but once and Billy Masters
and Lanky Staples came to see him and told him
of their doings. He hadn’t missed much in the
way of excitement, however, for the patrol boat
had done nothing more adventurous than fire at
a butter firkin, narrowly escape collision with a
trawler in a fog and back into a wharf at Provincetown.
Lanky expressed disgust at the monotonous
emptiness of existence and Billy hinted
darkly at deserting and enlisting in the British
Army in Canada if things didn’t pick up pretty
soon.</p>

<p>Nelson had plenty of time for thought during
that dragging fortnight, and the more he thought
the more he was inclined to agree with Lanky
and Billy. He had enlisted in the Naval Reserves
because he wanted to fight the Germans.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Apprehending a spy or two might be useful work,
but it wasn’t to his mind vital enough to the
matter in hand, which was beating Germany. He
had spoken very nearly the truth when he had
told Ensign Stowell that it wasn’t exactly revenge
for a personal injury inflicted that he sought, but
he was, after all, quite human, and there were
times when revenge seemed very desirable to him.
He still refused to believe, in the face of all probability,
that his father was really dead, although
none of his relatives up in Maine shared his
confidence. Nelson’s nearest relation now was
his Uncle Peter, a mild-mannered, elderly man
who had once served as mate on a lumber schooner
but who now eked out a scant living as proprietor
of a little store in the home town. Uncle Peter
firmly believed that his younger brother was dead,
and, or so it had seemed to Nelson, had taken
a sort of sad satisfaction in so believing. He had
frowned on the boy’s expressed determination of
entering the Navy and had even done what little
was in his power to thwart him. After a fortnight
at home, a home now presided over by
an ancient, sharp-featured woman housekeeper
whom Nelson had grown into the habit of calling
“Aunt Mehitabel,” although she was no relation,
he had bidden a constrained good-bye to Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Peter and a sad one to Pickles and, possessed of
the munificent sum of eighty-odd dollars, had
made his way to Boston. There a cousin by marriage
had taken him in overnight and the next
day he had sought advice, enlisted in the Reserves
and been sent to Newport.</p>

<p>The months that followed had been pleasant
and busy, and he had succeeded for whole hours at
a stretch in forgetting to be lonely. He had
made many acquaintances but no firm friends.
He didn’t make friends readily, it seemed, although
he was naturally affectionate and, now that
he no longer had his father to chum with, would
gladly have spent some of that pent-up affection
on one of his fellows. But that experience on
the night of the fourteenth of October had sobered
him even more than he himself realized
and possibly his quiet, silent ways unintentionally
held others off. He had done well at the station,
for he had more or less nautical knowledge
to build on and was keen to observe and quick to
learn. He had sought to specialize in gunnery,
but owing to the crowded condition of the station
at the time and to confusion resultant on constant
changes in plans and methods, he had made only
slight progress when his transference to the coast
Patrol Service came. He left the station with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
the rating of second-class seaman and with a good
all-around knowledge of a seaman’s duties.</p>

<p>As the time to report aboard the <i>Wanderer</i>
drew near he found that, while he was impatient
for duty again, existence aboard the patrol boat
appealed but little to him. He set his wits to
work in the endeavor to find some means of securing
a transfer, but when the morning of his
discharge from the hospital arrived, he had failed
so far to find any. The <i>Wanderer</i> was at Buzzard’s
Bay and he was to go there by train, arriving
at four-twenty in the afternoon. Between
New Bedford and Buzzard’s Bay Fate stepped
in and took a hand in his affairs.</p>

<p>The train was a leisurely one and stopped frequently.
Nelson, hunched in the window end of
a red velvet seat, with his canvas bag between his
feet—that bag holding nearly all his worldly
possessions until such time as the slow-moving arm
of the Law, set in motion by Uncle Peter, had
distributed his father’s estate—looked out on the
pleasant vistas of villages and harbors and open
water warming in the May sunlight and felt, for
some reason, rather pathetic. It was what he
himself would have called “a corking day,” and
yet the very “corkingness” of it somehow depressed
him. He was so busy feeling depressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
that he scarcely noticed when, after leaving one
of the small stations along the route, someone
took the other half of his seat. Nelson merely
drew into himself a bit more, kicked his bag a
little further toward the window and went on
being mournful. He didn’t see that the newcomer
observed him more than once with kindly interest
and seemed inclined to open a conversation.
He was a man of apparently fifty years, with
a pair of very deep blue eyes behind shell-rimmed
glasses, a closely-cropped gray mustache and a
sun-tanned face. He sat very erect in his seat, a
light overcoat, carefully folded, laid across the
knees of his immaculate steel-gray trousers, and
at intervals ran his gaze over a Boston morning
paper which, however, failed to hold his attention
for long at a time. It was he who finally
commenced the conversation.</p>

<p>“Transferring?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Nelson looked around rather blankly. “Sir?”</p>

<p>The man smiled. “I asked if you were transferring.
I see you have your bag with you.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’m rejoining my boat at Buzzard’s
Bay.”</p>

<p>The other nodded, darting a swift glance at
the boy’s cap ribbon. “<i>Wanderer</i>, eh? Patrol
boat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Nelson was, in turn, doing some
looking, too, and there was something about his
neighbor that suggested authority. Still it didn’t
do to talk too freely. They had been plentifully
warned against that.</p>

<p>“Been on liberty?” pursued the man.</p>

<p>“No, sir. Hospital.”</p>

<p>“Really? Nothing serious, I hope.”</p>

<p>“No, sir.” The gentleman looked expectant
of further details, but Nelson said no more. After
a moment the former asked: “Who’s in command
of the <i>Wanderer</i>?”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Hattuck.”</p>

<p>“Hattuck, eh?” He seemed trying to recall
something. Finally: “Yes, yes, of course. I
thought I knew the name. Commanded the <i>Andover</i>
in ’98. So he’s in the Reserve, is he? How
large is your boat, the <i>Wanderer</i>?”</p>

<p>“Not very big,” answered Nelson, evasively.
The other chuckled.</p>

<p>“You’re right, my boy, not to talk too much.
I forget that—Hm, let me see.” He dipped into
a pocket, drew forth a case and selected from it
a card which he passed across. “Merely to reassure
you,” he explained. Nelson accepted the bit
of engraved cardboard in surprise, a surprise
which increased when he read the name on it, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
name of a man high in the Naval affairs of the
nation.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir, I didn’t know——” began
Nelson in some confusion.</p>

<p>“Naturally you wouldn’t,” laughed the other.
“I’m not tagged, thank goodness! You see, I’ve
been on liberty too,” he added smiling, “but not,
I am glad to say, in hospital. I’ve been visiting
my family for a week. And now, like you, I’m
going back to duty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” murmured Nelson. As the Navy
man made no offer to take his card back the boy
held it in his hand, wondering what to do with
it. “I guess there’s plenty to do in Washington
just now, sir,” he hazarded.</p>

<p>The other nodded. “A terrific amount of
work, yes. I felt guilty most of the time I was
away; maybe I enjoyed my vacation more for that
reason,” he added with his contagious chuckle.
Nelson smiled in sympathy.</p>

<p>“It’s like playing hookey, sir,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“That’s it. How do you like the Reserve service—er—by
the way, what’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Troy, sir. I like it very well, only—I’d rather
be on the other side.”</p>

<p>“I see. Yes, of course. Well, I dare say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
you’ll get there in time. How long have you
been serving?”</p>

<p>“Only about five months. I joined in November.
I was at Newport until a month ago. Do
you think, sir——”</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the man, encouragingly, as Nelson
hesitated.</p>

<p>“Do you think I’d have stood a better chance
to get across soon if I’d joined the Navy instead
of the Reserves, sir?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that would have made much
difference, Troy. You youngsters have to wait
your turns, you know. We try to select men for
the other side who have seen service, but we can’t
be too particular now, for there’s a ship asking a
complement every day or two and you new men
are getting your chances fast. Navy enlistment
has been slower than we hoped for so far, but
I think it will pick up. Meanwhile you must
console yourself with the knowledge that what
you are doing along the coast is just as important
as what our lads are doing in British waters.
It’s very necessary work, even if it isn’t spectacular.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I suppose it is, only I want to learn
gunnery, and there isn’t much chance on our boat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
I’m hoping that if I don’t get across pretty soon
I’ll get transferred to the Atlantic Fleet.”</p>

<p>“Gunnery, eh?” mused the other. “I see.”
He was silent a minute. Then: “Just write your
name on the back of that card, will you?” he
asked. “Here’s a pencil. That’s it, thanks. I’ll
tuck this away and perhaps I can do something for
you before long. Now tell me,” he went on as
he slipped the card into a leather wallet, “about
that little adventure you had a couple of weeks
ago, for I take it that it was the <i>Wanderer</i> that
brought in that German spy, Lieutenant—Haegel,
isn’t it?—and his cronies.”</p>

<p>So Nelson told of the incident, and afterwards,
led on by his sympathetic audience, told about
everything else he knew! It was a veritable orgy
of talk for Nelson, and later on, no longer under
the spell of the other’s personality, he wondered
how he had ever come to do it! They parted at
a junction soon after Nelson had completed an
account of the attack on the <i>Jonas Clinton</i>, and
his new acquaintance shook hands and said he
hoped they would meet again and got off without
further reference to that half promise. But Nelson
rejoined the <i>Wanderer</i> in quite a hopeful
frame of mind and in much better spirits than
when he had left New Bedford. Of course, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
reflected, it might be that nothing would come of
that encounter, but there had been something about
the Navy official suggesting that he had a good
memory, and that his half promise was as good as
another man’s written agreement.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<small>ON THE THAMES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Those on the <i>Wanderer</i> were all so glad
to see him back, and showed it so positively,
that he felt almost disloyal in
wanting to leave the boat. Ensign Stowell, although
he only returned Nelson’s salute when the
latter stepped aboard, later shook hands with him
and enquired about the arm and was “so awfully
decent,” as Nelson called it to himself, that he
found himself wishing that Fate would somehow
fix it so that when his transfer came, if it did
come, he would find himself still under the Ensign.</p>

<p>A week passed, and then another, and he began
to think that, after all, he was destined to knock
about Cape Cod in the <i>Wanderer</i> for the rest of
the war. He had not mentioned the encounter
with the Navy official to anyone, not even to
Billy Masters, who would have heard it if anyone
had. And as the days went by and it became
more and more evident that nothing was to come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of that meeting on the train, he was glad he had
kept it to himself. He wondered whether the
official had lost the card with the name scrawled
on the back or whether he had just decided not
to bother about the affair.</p>

<p>Meanwhile life on the <i>Wanderer</i> was by no
means lacking in interest. They had been allowed,
at last, sufficient ammunition for gun practice
and this was held several times a week. Nelson
was assigned to the after gun crew, under
Lanky Staples, and in the course of the next
few weeks obtained quite a little instruction and
experience. Lanky had a fine contempt for the
toy, as he called the three-pounder, but managed
to make some creditable hits with it. Nelson
bought a book on ordnance and ammunition and
studied it in his leisure time, determined that
sooner or later he would qualify as gunner’s mate.
He got practice in sighting and loading and
showed enough promise to cause Cochran to take
him under his wing and teach him a good deal of
practical gunnery, which was the only kind the
gunner’s mate knew.</p>

<p>The <i>Wanderer</i> flitted up and down the coast
in fair weather and foul, although there was not
much of the latter that Spring, and had her moments
of interest. There was a submarine scare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
early in June and one breezy morning the patrol
boat went dashing off to the south, quite hopefully,
in obedience to orders. But the rumored
sub didn’t materialize and they ran into a heavy
sea and broke a propeller shaft and had to wallow
into New London for repairs. It was a three-day
job to install a new shaft and Nelson and Billy
Masters went sight-seeing on various occasions
and found quite a lot to interest them. Some
four hundred reserves from the Newport station
had recently been dumped down on a New London
pier and were using it as barracks, and they
discovered several acquaintances amongst them
and had a rather good time. They attended a
dance at the hotel one evening—although Nelson
didn’t dance, went over a mine layer, shopped
along State street and visited the submarine base
up at the old Navy Yard.</p>

<p>The latter excursion happened in an odd way.
Nelson and Billy were admiring some perfectly
gorgeous strawberry-pink and nile-green shirts
in a haberdasher’s window one afternoon when
they heard someone say:</p>

<p>“I’ll buy you a dozen of those if you’ll put
them on.” The speaker was a chap in sailor’s
togs whose cap ribbon bore the legend “U. S.
Submarine Base.” He was a good looking fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
about two years Nelson’s senior, slim, sun-browned
and merry, and Nelson took to him on the instant.
But it was Billy who answered; Billy always
had an answer ready.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ll put ’em on,” he said. “I’ll take the
pink ones.”</p>

<p>“Right-o! Me for you, son! Come on in and
pick them out.”</p>

<p>But Billy declined to carry his bluff any further.
“Tell you what I will do, though,” he
hedged. “I’ll take ’em now and wear ’em the
day we march into Berlin!”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing, old man. I want to live to
see it. What’s the <i>Wanderer</i>? Mine-layer?”</p>

<p>“No, coast patrol,” answered Billy. “We bust
a shaft the other day chasing a U-boat and are
in for repairs.”</p>

<p>“Chasing a U-boat? Sounds exciting. Catch
her?”</p>

<p>“We would have, but she wasn’t there,” replied
Billy gravely. “Are you up at the submarine
base? Do they allow folks in there?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And they don’t. But if you want to
look us over I’ll fix it for you. What are you
doing now? Want to run up and see us? I’ll
give you transportation.” He nodded at a vividly
blue roadster automobile at the curb. “That’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
my boat, and if you don’t mind squeezing a
bit——”</p>

<p>“Phew!” exclaimed Billy. “Do they supply
you with those dinguses? Guess I’ll transfer to
the submarine branch and get me one.”</p>

<p>The car was a handsome affair of a world-famous
foreign make. Their new acquaintance
laughed.</p>

<p>“No, I had that and brought it with me.
We’re about three miles from town and it’s a
long way to walk. What do you say? Want to
take a ride?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know,” agreed Billy. “Who
gets in first?”</p>

<p>“I do. One of you can sit on the seat and
the other on the floor. Don’t drag your feet,
though, it tears up the road. All right? Here
we go then.”</p>

<p>The blue car chugged demurely enough down
the street and took its place with a dozen other
vehicles before the ferry slip. The driver shut
off the engine, since the boat was only just entering,
and turned to Nelson, who was in the seat,
while Billy sat on the floor, with his knees hunched
under his chin, and observed the world with a
cheerful grin. “How long have you been this
way?” asked the owner of the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“What way?” inquired Nelson.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can talk?” laughed the other. “I
thought you were dumb. I wondered if you were
born that way or if it was just shell-shock!
Where’s your ship?”</p>

<p>Nelson pointed across to the yard. “On the
ways over there. I don’t have to talk when
Masters is around. Have you been at the submarine
base long?”</p>

<p>“No, only about two months. If I stay two
months more I’ll be gray-headed. It’s a hard
life.” But he smiled as he said it, and Nelson
took the statement with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>“Have you ever been submerged?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they send us down every little while.
Maybe they’re hoping we won’t come up again,
but we always do. So far,” he added as an afterthought
and with a grin.</p>

<p>“Do you like it? The submarine service, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“First rate. It’s mighty interesting and the
fellows are corkers; officers, too—most of them.
I’d like to see some service, though, before the
war’s over. They say they’re likely to keep us
up here six or eight months. Think the war will
last that long?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>“I think it will last several years yet,” replied
Nelson soberly.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the other, starting his engine
again as the procession of vehicles moved
toward the now empty boat. “No, I didn’t mean
that, of course,” he corrected when they were
on board. “But I certainly do want a crack at
the Huns before it’s over. Want to get out and
go forward?”</p>

<p>Nelson elected to remain where he was, but
Billy murmured something and strolled off toward
the bow.</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Nelson, taking up the conversation
again. “I want to get across as soon as I
can. I suppose it’s pretty hard to get into the submarine
school, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, rather. I was in the Naval Militia, but
I dropped out and enlisted in the Navy and applied
for the submarine branch. Somehow, I
got it. Most of the fellows are service men,
though.”</p>

<p>Billy moseyed back and perched himself on the
floorboards again and the blue car rattled across
the gang-plank, charged up-hill in the wake of its
fellows, turned abruptly to the left and dashed
off in a cloud of dust. There wasn’t much conversation
on the way up to the base, for the driver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
had his hands full keeping the lurching car to the
road and his guests were very busy holding themselves
in. But they did exchange names. And
soon after that Martin Townsend—for that, it
developed, was the car owner’s name—turned the
automobile into a field and jumped out.</p>

<p>“How do you like my garage?” he inquired
laughingly.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it lives out here?” exclaimed
Nelson. The other nodded.</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know. They aren’t very
much interested in our autos. I notice, though,
that the officers are mighty glad to borrow them
when they want to get to town, or to beg a ride.
Say, I’ve gone into New London with eight in that
old boat! Had them clinging on to every part
except the wheels! Come on down and I’ll see
if I can get you through.”</p>

<p>They were halted by a guard, but Townsend
was haughty and insistent and they were finally
allowed to enter the gate. There wasn’t much
that was imposing about the submarine base, but
they found it interesting. Townsend took them
into the barracks, introduced them to several fellows
and then led the way down to the boats.
There were only four submarines tied up at the
stone dock that afternoon and their guide explained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
that the others were cruising or doing
submerging stunts down the river. They were
shown over one of the craft and Billy, who, to
use his own words, had never seen one of the
contraptions close up, was visibly impressed and
asked so many questions that Townsend began
to look distressed and Nelson dragged his friend
back to the dock. Townsend apologized for not
taking them back to the ferry in his car, but he had
used up his day’s liberty, and so, shaking hands
cordially, the boys took leave and climbed into a
decrepit “jitney” that had just unloaded three
young officers at the gate. Townsend waved them
a gay farewell, a straight, lithe form against the
sunset glow, and was lost to sight. Nelson was
sorry to leave him, for he had taken an unusual
fancy to the chap, and he hoped that they would
meet again.</p>

<p>They rattled back through a golden haze of
dust, dodging other cars by a series of miracles,
and reached the <i>Wanderer</i> barely in time to escape
a reprimand. They saw Martin Townsend
once more before the <i>Wanderer</i> weighed anchor.
It was the following morning. Nelson, Billy and
Lanky Staples were leaning over the rail after
breakfast when there came a swishing sound from
the other side of the boat and they looked across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the cabin roof. The sound came from a submarine
running down-river on the surface. She
passed close to the <i>Wanderer</i> and the two officers
on the conning tower saluted Lieutenant Hattuck,
while the half dozen men standing or walking
about the narrow deck waved across. One of
them was Townsend, looking much less trim today
in a soiled dungaree. He put his hands to
his mouth and said something, but Nelson couldn’t
get the message, and, under the sharp eyes of the
officers, Townsend didn’t dare repeat it. In a
moment the submarine had slipped stealthily past
and, with a final wave of his hand, Townsend
vanished as the superstructure hid him from view.
That, thought Nelson regretfully, was probably
the last time he would ever see the fellow. But
Fortune plays odd pranks, and, although Nelson
couldn’t know it then, he was destined to meet
Martin Townsend again before long and under
strange circumstances.</p>

<p>The <i>Wanderer</i> left New London that afternoon
and dropped anchor in New Bedford just
before supper time. Ensign Stowell went ashore
and came back about nine with mail and newspapers.
The arrival of mail was a matter of slight
interest to Nelson, since letters seldom came his
way. It always made him feel a little lonesome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
and neglected to watch the others tear open envelopes
and hear them read bits of home news,
and tonight he left the forecastle to its pleasant
diversion and went up on deck. The watch was
on duty at the bow, while aft Lieutenant Hattuck
and his junior were pacing up and down in
conversation. Nelson leaned against the wheel
house and watched the lights of the town, and
presently bits of the officers’ talk came to him
along the deck, for the June night was calm, with
scarce a breath of wind blowing, and the harbor
was quiet.</p>

<p>“Well, I see ‘Black Jack’s’ reached the other
side,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Yes, the London dispatches make quite a lot
of it.”</p>

<p>“It’s epochal, Jack. Look at it. An American
general and his staff welcomed in England, cheered
on the dock and along the street, if the paper
speaks true, received like a conqueror——”</p>

<p>The voices died away. Then: “I’m glad it’s
Pershing,” the ensign was saying as the couple
neared the listener again. “They’ll like him, the
English. He’s quiet, unassuming, business-like,
just the man for the job.”</p>

<p>“Hope they give him a free hand over there.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
He will be too far from home to succeed if they
nag him. What I’d like to know——”</p>

<p>So it was General Pershing who had arrived
in England, thought Nelson. He tried to picture
the event, thrilling a little with pride as he did so.
The lieutenant was right: it <em>was</em> epochal. All
sorts of epoch-making events were happening nowadays,
and would happen. It was rumored that
a big army was to follow the commander across
within the month. Think of an American army
in France! The Stars-and-Stripes waving over
her trampled, blood-stained battle-fields! It was
wonderful and glorious; and it made him feel
more out of it than ever. While such great things
were happening he was scrubbing decks and polishing
bright-work and greasing toy guns on a converted
motor boat along Cape Cod! It was unbearable!</p>

<p>He had been so busy with his thoughts that he
had not heard the officers’ talk for several moments
when he was suddenly aroused by the sound
of his own name. It was the lieutenant who spoke
it and Nelson caught only the tag end of the sentence:</p>

<p>“——Troy. Have him report to me in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the other. “I’m glad for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
sake. He’s been wanting badly to get across. I
told you about his father, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Too bad. Thinks he’s still living, you
said. Not much chance, I’d say. Still——”</p>

<p>Nelson’s heart thumped wildly. It had come
at last! He wondered where they were sending
him and would have given a good deal to have
been able to ask just then. But it wouldn’t do.
He must wait until morning. He was going
across; the ensign had said as much; and that was
the main thing! It didn’t matter a bit what the
ship was so long as it sailed for France or England.
He felt sorry for the others then: Lanky,
whose one ambition was to serve a fourteen-inch
gun; Ensign Stowell, too, and Billy, and all the
rest. They would still be kicking their heels
aboard the <i>Wanderer</i> back home while he, Nelson,
was in the thick of it. Then he wondered if
he had heard aright. Perhaps, after all, he had
been mistaken. He listened as the officers paced
back toward him, but now they were talking of
other things. After awhile he went below and
laid down in his bunk and was alternately happy
and depressed until he finally fell into what was to
prove his last sleep aboard the <i>Wanderer</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<small>THE U. S. S. “GYANDOTTE”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“What’s the land over there?” asked
Nelson, nodding westward toward the
low, faint line of shore.</p>

<p>“North Carolina,” replied the tall youth whose
sleeve bore the crossed quills of a yeoman.
“That’s Cape Hatteras, further along.”</p>

<p>Nelson craned his neck. The shore-line
stretched out as though to meet them, a distant
angle of sand-reefs, slightly more distinct than
the land abeam.</p>

<p>“Is it?” he asked interestedly. “I’ve heard of
Hatteras.”</p>

<p>“You’re in luck only to have heard of it,” grumbled
the other. “Mostly you feel it! We’re getting
into it now. This is the roughest stretch between
Cape Cod and the Florida Keys. You want
to try it when there’s a good off-shore gale if you
want some real fun! This your first voyage?”</p>

<p>“My first in the Navy, except knocking around
for a month or so on a patrol boat up north. I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
never been south before. I suppose you’ve been
in the service a long time.”</p>

<p>“Three years,” answered the yeoman nonchalantly
yet proudly. “This is my fourth ship. I
was on the old <i>Missouri</i> first. Then the <i>Montana</i>,
and after that the <i>Tacoma</i>. Now it’s this old
tub.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is the <i>Gyandotte</i> a tub?” asked Nelson
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Sure she is. She’s sixteen years old and was
out of commission until the war started. They’ve
tinkered her up so she’ll hold together for a year
or so, maybe. They say she’s got new engines,
but I don’t know if it’s so. Reckon the Old Man’s
keeping her close to shore in case she falls apart.”</p>

<p>Nelson looked through the port and across the
leagues of tumbling muddy-gray water. “At that
it would be a long swim,” he said with a smile.
“Do you know where we’re going?”</p>

<p>The yeoman nodded above his folded arms.
“Bahamas and around there. Anyway, that’s
what I heard. The papers had a piece about a
German raider off Great Abaco last week and I
reckon we’re sent down to have a look-see. But,
shucks, there isn’t a German ship this side of the
Azores, unless it’s a sub that’s missed her way.
We’ll go down there and cruise around for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
month without getting foot on shore and then
waddle home again and go into dry dock for repairs.
It’s sure punk luck, getting stuck on this
old spile-driver.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think, then, that they’ll send the
<i>Gyandotte</i> across to the other side?”</p>

<p>“Her? She couldn’t do it, not unless they
towed her,” was the contemptuous reply. “If
you wanted to get across you’d better have stuck
to your patrol boat. They’re sending those over
all the time. Well, I’ve got to be stirring.”</p>

<p>The youth sighed and moved off along the spotless
deck, his wide trousers flapping around his
long, thin shanks. Left to himself Nelson
watched the far, thin, low-lying streak of sand
that was Cape Hatteras and wondered if what the
yeoman had told him as to the ship’s destination
was true. It was nearly a week since he had said
good-by to the <i>Wanderer</i> and taken train for Norfolk.
There he had reported at the Navy Yard,
according to orders, and been assigned to the third
class cruiser <i>Gyandotte</i>, at the time loading supplies
and taking on the final coat of gray war
paint. The <i>Gyandotte</i>, after the <i>Wanderer</i>, had
seemed a truly majestic ship and that she was
headed straight for France or England had
seemed quite within the probabilities, until Nelson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
had mentioned the idea to others. After that
his hopes had dwindled, for his notion produced
laughter or sarcasm. He was assured that when
the <i>Gyandotte</i> saw the coast of France the bilge-pump
would be spouting gold dollars. And now
this other fellow, he of the crossed quills and long
legs, had corroborated previous pronouncements.
It was rather discouraging, thought Nelson.</p>

<p>The cruiser was behaving very flippantly now,
rolling and pitching at a great rate, and he had to
steady himself to keep on his feet. The <i>Gyandotte</i>
was only a little over three thousand tonnage
and was, as the yeoman had said, an old
ship. Her length was 305 feet. She was schooner
rigged, with two very tall funnels. For armament
she carried ten five-inch breech-loading rifles
and six six-pounder rapid fire guns. She had been
credited with something under seventeen knots
when built, but there was a rumor current about
the ship today that she had been newly equipped
with “kettles” that could drive her close to twenty.
Nelson was one of several hundred capable-looking
young men in blue flannel who had been gathered
from many sources. Some, like Nelson himself,
were green hands, and some few were Reserves,
but most had seen more or less service on
other ships. Nelson had been assigned to the port<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
watch and to the crew of Number Four gun of
the main battery as second shellman. That was
interesting, although after the first drill his arms
ached from lifting the shells, and had the little
<i>Gyandotte</i> been headed across the Atlantic instead
of southward along the coast he would have been
more than contented.</p>

<p>They had steamed out of Norfolk early that
morning in a heavy rain and a flat green sea.
Now, mid-afternoon, the rain had ceased and the
sea was no longer flat nor green. It was decidedly
boisterous and looked heavy with sand.
Mist had taken the place of rain, a mist almost
too fine to be seen but which lay in globules and
little pools on every flat surface. There was a
softness in the air that was new to Nelson, a mildness
that seemed to presage the southern latitudes
toward which the little gray cruiser was plowing
her way.</p>

<p>So far, in spite of the fact that he had been
aboard three days, Nelson had made few acquaintances
and no friends. This, however, need not
be wondered at, for it was almost equally true of
all others on the ship. It requires more than three
days for officers and men to find themselves and
to get shaken down. The process of evolving order
out of the confusion resultant on gathering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
several hundred men of all branches together on a
ship quite new to them is a slow one. The process
begins at once and moves steadily, but a deal of
training and instruction is necessary, and the machinery
of a modern warship is complex indeed.
Officers must learn to know each other and their
men, and the men, in the same way, must learn to
know their officers and each other. Every soul
on board has a particular and personal duty, or
set of duties, to perform. When a member of the
crew goes aboard he receives his station billet
which tells him his rating, his watch number, his
part of the ship, his mess, his boat and his station
at quarters and fire quarters. He finds himself
immediately under the authority of a leader who
is, in turn, subordinate to a higher authority. A
battleship has six departments: Gunnery, Navigation,
Engineering, Construction, Medical and
Pay. These, in turn, are subdivided into seventeen
divisions, as, in the Engineering Department,
Main Engines Division, Boilers Division and Auxiliaries
Division. Each division is a government
itself responsible to the Executive Officer.</p>

<p>Smaller ships follow the same plan of organization,
but have fewer divisions, the chief difference
being in the Gunnery Department owing to
fewer guns and, frequently, absence of torpedo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
tubes. The ship is divided into sections from bow
to stern, sometimes by bulkheads and sometimes
by imaginary lines, and each section includes all
space between keel and main deck, or the top of
gun turrets above the main deck. These sections
correspond in number to the gun divisions of the
main battery and each is in charge of the senior
officer of that gun division, who is responsible for
the cleanliness, orderliness and upkeep of his section.
A certain number of men of the proper ratings
are assigned to each of the divisions. As
nearly as possible the men of a division are kept
together in the ship’s routine and as close to their
battle stations as may be practicable. Each division
is divided into four sections for duties, for
keeping watch and for liberty, which is navy parlance
for shore leave.</p>

<p>Perfect discipline is the foundation upon which
the organization is built, and the recruit must
learn discipline and subordination to authority
first of all. But he must learn those things without
losing his self-reliance, for he will be constantly
called on to act on his own responsibility. He is
one of hundreds of other units. These units are
formed into small groups under a subleader. The
small groups are again formed into larger groups
under other subleaders. The larger groups in turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
form the whole, and above the whole stands the
captain. Each man must know not only his own
particular specialty, whether that of seaman, gunnery
expert, boiler maker, carpenter, mess attendant
or stoker, but must learn to so coöperate with
his fellow workers that the many separate units
will be welded into one coördinating whole. The
ship must be navigated and controlled, the guns
kept in condition and fired, the engines and boilers
operated, all parts of the ship kept in repair,
the officers and men fed, and a dozen other duties
performed, and all these activities must be so unified
that they will come under the control of one
mind, that of the captain.</p>

<p>Drills form a large part of the instruction
method and are provided to prepare the officers
and men for any emergency. They include battle
drills such as Strip Ship, General Quarters and
Torpedo Defense Quarters, emergency drills such
as Fire, Collision, Abandon Ship and Watertight
Integrity, and gun drills. There are, besides these,
the ship manuals, guard mounting, general muster
and inspection. There was on the <i>Gyandotte</i>,
however, no need for the Strip Ship drill, for
everything not necessary in war time had been removed
at the navy yard before sailing; wooden
doors and lockers, unnecessary boats, spars,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
booms, ladders, davits, stanchions, ventilators and
inflammables. In short, everything not absolutely
needed for the moderate comfort of the personnel
and the conduct of war had been left behind. In
battle, articles of wood, whether fixtures or furnishings,
have an unpleasant way of splintering
under shell fire and, besides, may become ignited.
Prior to an actual engagement the call of Clear
Ship for Action frequently consigns still other
things to a watery grave.</p>

<p>Nelson stood first watch that night and turned
into his hammock at midnight. The <i>Gyandotte</i>
was riding on a more even keel now and the sway
of his swinging bed was only enough to help him
pass quickly into a sound slumber.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>THE RAIDER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Two days later, in sight of Mariguana
Island, they found the Chilian bark <i>San
Felipe</i>, or what was left of her. She had
a cargo of rough lumber aboard and although little
remained above-deck the hulk was still afloat.
Shell fire had carried away masts and deck houses
and left gaping wounds in the hull. The <i>Gyandotte</i>
sent an officer aboard and the latter speedily
returned with the word that the attack, from the
evidence found, had taken place not over twenty-four
hours before. The ship was deserted and all
valuables had been removed. That the deed had
been done by the German raider previously reported
was the belief of officers and men, and what
had looked before like a wild-goose chase suddenly
assumed importance. Spirits arose on the
cruiser and for the rest of that day, while she
ran southward, every man off duty elected himself
lookout. But finding the raider, about whom little
was known, was a difficult task. They passed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
British gunboat just before evening and exchanged
signals, with the result that the <i>Gyandotte</i> turned
groaningly back and steamed northward again.
Several times smoke was sighted, but each chase
only raised a friendly ship. The next morning
the <i>Gyandotte</i> was out of sight of anything that
even suggested land and doing her best clip, which
proved to be nineteen and a half knots. At noon
that day the radio man picked up cheering news
which was posted on the bulletin:</p>

<p>“United States torpedo boat <i>Benton</i> sighted a
ship believed to be an enemy raider at five-thirty
o’clock yesterday evening and fired eight shots but
was unable to hit owing to extreme range. The
enemy refused battle and made her escape at about
eighteen knots.”</p>

<p>“They might tell us where,” grumbled a young
gunner’s mate of Nelson’s watch. “For all that
says it might have been up around Newfoundland!”</p>

<p>But there was a general feeling throughout the
ship that the <i>Benton’s</i> encounter with the raider
had been rather nearer at hand than that and that
somewhere this side of Bermuda, toward which
the cruiser was scouting, there would be something
doing. Foretop and maintop lookout kept a sharp
watch that day, but night closed down over a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
tumbling sea without reward. In the wireless
house the blue sparks sizzled and spat busily, and
rumors flew about above deck and below incessantly.
But Nelson, like many others, turned in
that night a prey to disappointment.</p>

<p>It was shortly before six bells the next forenoon
that the welcome, long-deferred and exciting news
went the rounds that the foretop lookout had
sighted smoke. All hands who might crowded
forward, but from the deck nothing was as yet to
be seen. It was well over an hour later when the
quarry raised above the horizon sufficiently to be
visible to the crew. Then began a long, hard
chase. The <i>Gyandotte’s</i> boilers roared as never
before in that ship’s sixteen years of existence and
black smoke belched from her two high funnels
and poured off to port. But after a short while it
became evident that the enemy, if she was the enemy,
which there was no reason to doubt, was
making nearly if not quite as good speed. By the
middle of the afternoon it was apparent that there
was no hope of overtaking the raider before dark,
if ever, for the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> best effort had gained
only a few miles in the six hours that had elapsed
since sighting the quarry. There were grumbles
and mutters uncomplimentary to the <i>Gyandotte</i>
amongst the men, and it is not to be doubted that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the officers, too, sighed for something speedier
underfoot than the little cruiser. Night came
down quickly, far too quickly to please those on
the pursuer, and the distant shape of the raider
faded from vision. That, since she was plainly
refusing battle, she would seek to escape under
cover of darkness by altering her course was a
foregone conclusion, and it is fair to assume that
there were many anxious discussions in the ward
room that evening.</p>

<p>All night the <i>Gyandotte</i> plunged ahead at nearly
twenty-one miles an hour. The noise of the engines
and the plunging of the ship made sleep more
than difficult for Nelson. Then, too, he was in a
condition of excitement and suspense that sent his
thoughts racing toward the morrow and kept his
brain hard at work. And yet he did sleep, just
as, if one was to judge from certain sounds that
came from nearby hammocks, did others, and
didn’t awake until reveille sent him tumbling out to
restore his canvas couch to its lashings and make
his hasty toilet. He didn’t have to ask any questions,
for the news was hurrying from man to
man that the German was still in sight and that
the cruiser had cut down the lead considerably. If
the <i>Gyandotte</i> had felt hurt the day before by the
aspersions cast on her she must have been almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
if not quite placated this morning, for they called
her “some little hiker” and “a bulldog for grit”
and approved her heartily.</p>

<p>It was ten when they got their first good look
at the enemy. She was then some ten miles distant,
presenting only a stern view, but with glasses
it was possible to form some idea of her. She
appeared slightly larger than the <i>Gyandotte</i>, with
a good deal to be seen above-deck, the latter fact
suggesting that she was a converted craft of some
sort, possibly a small, fast merchantman. At two
bells in the afternoon watch, just after mess, the
shrill sound of the boatswain’s pipe was heard
commanding “Clear ship for action!” and all
hands sprang to the work of stowing loose gear,
connecting fire hose, rigging life lines and performing
the almost numberless duties called for.
Galley fires were hauled, lunch served out, ammunition
supplied, dressing stations rigged, circuits
tested and blast screens rigged. In a short time
the cruiser was in fighting trim, the men had
washed and shifted into clean underclothes and
the battle ensigns were flying at the mastheads.
The crew of Number Four gun hovered impatiently
about the platform, one of them at least
suffering inconvenience with his heart which
showed an annoying disposition to travel back and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
forth between its usual location and his throat, or
to seem to!</p>

<p>Shortly after two o’clock the enemy began the
action at a hopeless range. The shell fell far
short of its mark, although the direction was good.
The challenge was answered on the <i>Gyandotte</i>
by the bugle call of General Quarters and the
men hurried to stations. A second shell from the
German raider fell short and was followed quickly
by a third which flung up the water close aboard.
Not until then did the <i>Gyandotte</i> reply. Her bow
guns spoke, but there were no hits. The enemy
was evidently more desirous of running away than
giving battle, for her firing was desultory and inaccurate
for the succeeding quarter of an hour,
during which the pursuer fired seldom and with
no effect. At about eight thousand yards the real
music began. It was then about two-thirty-five
and the cruiser was approximately one hundred
and twenty miles southwest of Bermuda. To
the enemy went first blood, for a shell burst on
deck forward of the bridge, carrying away part
of that structure and damaging the foremast range
finder. But after that it was the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> battle.
The enemy’s after deck was raked clean five
minutes after the main action started and she was
repeatedly hulled during the ensuing fifty minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
As long as possible she kept up full speed, but
at a few minutes before three those on the cruiser
observed that she had begun to list slightly to
starboard and coincidently her speed diminished
and in a short while the <i>Gyandotte</i> was able to
open up with her secondary battery.</p>

<p>Number Four gun played its part in the game,
and Nelson, passing fifty-pound shells till the perspiration
rolled from his face and trickled down
his bare arms, experienced a savage exaltation
as word came of hits. It was hard, fast work.
<a href="#i_fp092">There was a crash as the shell sped from the gun.</a>
Then the plugman opened the breech, wiped
and inserted the primer. “Bore clear!” cried
the first shellman, shoved a shell into the breech
and shut off the air valve. A powderman inserted
a charge in its silk bag and with it rammed home
the shell. The plugman closed the breech and
shouted “Ready!” Another roar burst forth.
And so it went. There was no time to wonder
or speculate on what was going on in other parts
of the ship. One’s duty was before one and required
every instant of time. Number Four
barked with scarcely a let-up for most of the fifty-odd
minutes that the engagement lasted and there
were times toward the end of that period when
Nelson found himself working without conscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
effort, mechanically lifting and handing the heavy
shells as though he were only a cog in a machine.
His arms and back and legs ached, but he didn’t
know it then. His thoughts went back often to
that midnight of the fourteenth of last October
and when they did the lines of his face set more
grimly.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Gyandotte</i> didn’t escape unscathed, for the
enemy scored seven hits during the battle. One
of the cruiser’s guns was early put out of action
and a shell bored its way into a coal bunker and
caused devastation below decks. That the <i>Gyandotte</i>
presented only her bow to the enemy saved
her from worse treatment. Less than an hour
after the action had begun, the enemy ship signaled
surrender. She was then in a sinking condition,
with her starboard rail well under water.
Firing ceased at three minutes past four and the
<i>Gyandotte</i>, her men waving and cheering, steamed
slowly toward the defeated enemy and began to
lower her boats.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<small>OFF FOR THE OTHER SIDE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The captured steamship proved to be the
<i>Mahlow</i>, before the war a French passenger
ship plying between Marseilles
and Spanish ports under the name of the <i>Golfe du
Lion</i>. She was of some thirty-seven hundred tons.
She had been armed with small caliber guns in
profusion, for her main deck fairly bristled with
them and a multiplicity of ports had been cut
on the lower deck. The latter were not apparent
when closed, and, as the deck guns were easily
hidden, she doubtless looked quite harmless when
posing as a merchantman. She was credited by
Lloyd’s with being a fast ship, and her inability
to get away from the <i>Gyandotte</i> was later explained
by her engineer force as due to poor
coal taken aboard at a South American port. She
had been at sea two months and had in that time
caused considerable havoc from Rio de Janeiro
north to the Caribbean. When taken she had on
board twenty-six men of the crews of the <i>San</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
<i>Felipe</i> and a second vessel, both destroyed within
the past three weeks. These men, however,
seemed scarcely more pleased to reach the deck
of the <i>Gyandotte</i> than did the bulk of the German
sailors. About half of the <i>Mahlow’s</i> complement
was taken aboard the cruiser and the rest was
taken care of by the United States gunboat <i>Hastings</i>,
which appeared shortly after the surrender.
The <i>Hastings’</i> men were a disgruntled lot, for the
tiny gunboat had nearly ripped her seams for six
hours in an effort to get to the scene. The
<i>Mahlow</i> had twenty-two dead and a score injured,
while aboard her adversary eight had been killed
and nine wounded. Of the dead five were of
the crew of Number One gun and the rest were
of the engineering force. Among the <i>Mahlow’s</i>
wounded was her executive officer, a young junior
lieutenant, who later died in hospital. What happened
to the other prisoners Nelson never learned.
The last he saw of them was at Norfolk two days
later when they were marched away under a guard
of marines.</p>

<p>The <i>Mahlow</i> was hopelessly battered and sank
about six o’clock, rolling over like a dead whale
just before she went under. Her officers looked
on unemotionally from the decks of the two enemy
ships, seeming to those who watched them more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
relieved than sorry to see the last of the raider.
To Nelson fell the duty of guarding a squad of
the prisoners the next day. The men were herded
in two lots on the lower deck and the officers
occupied fairly comfortable quarters aft. Many
of the prisoners had been supplied with clothing,
for when taken aboard they were in some cases
in tatters. Nelson found that nearly half of the
German sailors spoke English enough to be understood.
To him they seemed a rather childish
lot, more concerned with the rations dealt to
them than with their recent misfortunes or their
ultimate fate. There were exceptions, however,
notably one dark-visaged man who wore the insignia
of a machinist’s mate. This man refused
to eat any food for the first twenty-four hours
and spent his time reviling his captors and, or so
it appeared, his companions. The latter seemed
in fear of him, but the fact didn’t keep them from
grinning at him behind his back.</p>

<p>The ship’s doctor and assistants were busy all
the way across to Norfolk, for some of the wounds
sustained by the injured men of the German ship
were serious. The bodies of the dead aboard
the <i>Mahlow</i> had gone down with the ship, but
on stretchers, under sheets of sailcloth the <i>Gyandotte’s</i>
dead went back to their own country for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
burial. Nelson couldn’t help reflecting that the
shell that had wrecked Number One gun might
just as easily have chosen Number Four, in which
case it was probable that he would have been lying
quiet under a tarpaulin or groaning in the sick
bay at this moment. But he didn’t let his thoughts
dwell overmuch on that subject. Life was a thing
one risked when one joined the country’s forces
in time of war, and whether one was to die or
come safely through was up to the Great Commander.</p>

<p>At Norfolk the <i>Gyandotte</i> underwent repairs
and lay in the harbor four days with steam up.
Liberty was granted the second day, but not after,
and life aboard threatened to grow monotonous
in spite of drills and duties. The newspapers made
all they could of the action off Bermuda, but,
as the Navy Department had given out but the
barest facts, there was little to build a story on.
Nelson made friends of a sort and picked up all
the information and lore obtainable on the subject
of guns, ammunition, explosives and fire control.
Garey, gun captain of Number Four, was the
chief victim of Nelson’s passion for knowledge,
and Garey, who wore two service stripes and
the Navy “E,” and who was an untalkative chap
ordinarily, spent hours at various times on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
boy’s enlightenment. Nelson soon had a large
fund of information on many subjects concerned
with gunnery. He learned the why and wherefore
of gas check pads and rings, and how to seat
them, learned how to clear powder chamber and
mushroom head of oil before firing, how to sponge
and re-oil after, learned that anyone using emery
or brick dust on certain parts was inherently a
criminal who would murder his poor old blind
grandmother, learned how to find leaks in the
recoil cylinders and how to refill them and much
more severely practical information, some of
which he had known and forgotten and much of
which was new to him.</p>

<p>He dipped into the subject of explosives, which
he found intensely interesting, and borrowed a
book about them from the ship’s library and, I
suspect, made rather a nuisance of himself during
those four days at anchor and for several days
after.</p>

<p>Norfolk was a busy scene just then and scarcely
a day passed that didn’t witness the arrival or departure
of one or more warships. There were
submarines there, too, and Nelson often wondered
if Martin Townsend was aboard one of them.
On the morning of the fourth day of the <i>Gyandotte’s</i>
stay there was much activity in the submarine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
basin, followed just before noon by a wholesale
exodus of the little underwater craft. They
went sliding past the cruiser on their way out to
sea, one after another, until Nelson had counted
eight of them. Somehow and somewhere the
rumor started that they were going across under
their own steam, which rumor, whether true or
not, aroused much enthusiasm on the <i>Gyandotte</i>,
and as the subs filed past they were roundly
cheered.</p>

<p>That same afternoon the <i>Gyandotte</i>, too, up-anchored
and stood out past Fortress Monroe
and Cape Charles and set her course northeastward.
There was a heavy rain falling and the
lights ashore twinkled wanly as the cruiser crossed
the mouth of the bay. Nelson spent a wet watch
on deck between midnight and four in the morning
and was heartily glad to throw off his glistening
rubber clothing and turn in at eight bells. In
the morning the <i>Gyandotte</i> was steaming at half-speed,
out of sight of land, at the tail-end of a one
column formation of cruisers and destroyers that
reached ahead until lost in the gray murk. It
was a miserable, cheerless sort of morning, and
even “chow” with all the hot coffee he could
drink didn’t dispel the gloom. But something
else did shortly after, for there appeared on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
ship’s bulletin the soul-stirring announcement that
the <i>Gyandotte</i> was to convoy submarines to an
American base in British waters!</p>

<p>There was joy, loud and unrestrained, on the
cruiser. Nelson forgot lowering skies, unfriendly
sea and reeking decks and wanted to cheer or
dance—or both. There was only one fly in the
ointment, and that was indicated by Ferris, the
lanky third class yeoman who had been one of
Nelson’s first acquaintances on board.</p>

<p>“It’ll be a rotten voyage,” said Ferris mournfully.
“Those subs are old tubs that can’t stand
any weather and we’ll be waiting on them hand
and foot all the way. Likely as not we’ll have
to tow them! It’ll take us about two weeks to
get over, you mark my words, Troy. And if
we don’t lose two or three of them on the way
it’ll be a miracle.”</p>

<p>But Nelson wasn’t to be downcast by any such
talk as that. He had long since decided that
Ferris was a natural-born pessimist, anyway.
And, besides, Nelson wasn’t particular how long
the voyage lasted just so long as it led them to
the other side. What did worry him slightly
was the question of whether the <i>Gyandotte</i>, which,
after all, was a third class cruiser and, even for
her class, not especially efficient as a warship, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
to remain on the other side or come home again.
If, he decided, she was to do the latter, and he
learned of it in time, he would do all in his power
short of actually deserting, to remain behind.
However, there was no sense in crossing a bridge
before you came to it, and meanwhile he was in
high spirits.</p>

<p>The weather got thick toward noon and the
half-speed became less than half and the bow
lookouts had their work cut out for them, for
there is always danger of treading on the heels
of the ship ahead of you in a heavy fog. Nothing
of the sort happened, however, and somewhere
that night they picked up their charges.
When it was Nelson didn’t know, for he was
asleep at the time, but when he looked out the
next morning there they were, fourteen of the
little steel cylinders, bobbing along with the spray
drenching their canvas-protected bridges and the
waves breaking along the decks. They were a
plucky lot, Nelson decided, and he told himself
that he wasn’t half sorry to be where he was instead
of in one of those tiny “tin cigars.” But,
nevertheless, he found that down at the bottom
of his heart was a sort of sneaking desire to see
what it was like to eat and sleep and have his
being in one of the strange craft. There were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
all kinds in sight, single hull and combination,
coastal and fleet, large and small. Indeed, one
tiny Class H boat, which was wallowing along
within a short distance of the <i>Gyandotte</i>, looked
to be scarcely more than a toy and appeared to
have set forth on a most suicidal venture. Further
ahead were larger boats, submarines of possibly
a thousand or twelve hundred tons displacement
with sterns queerly cut away and much superstructure.
In the gray of the morning it was
difficult to pick them out a half mile away so
closely did their hulls match the hue of sky and
water. They were in two column formation, well
spaced, and the leaders were far away from the
<i>Gyandotte</i>, their presence indicated now and then
by a dash of white foam when a wave broke
against a conning tower. The convoyers consisted
of three cruisers, the <i>Gyandotte</i> amongst them,
a heavy looking, high-decked ship which someone
said was a submarine tender and two destroyers
of about four hundred tons, themselves looking
scarcely more seaworthy than their charges. All
that day the flotilla steamed northeastward and
all of the next, the weather remaining either
drizzly or foggy. Some time in the early morning
of the fourth day after leaving Norfolk the light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
on Cape Sable shone off to port and in the afternoon
they put in to Halifax.</p>

<p>That was rather fun, for they received a fine
reception from the warships and merchantmen
lying in the outer harbor and, later, ashore, were
welcomed quite as cordially. There was liberty
every day during the four days the ships lay there,
and Nelson, sometimes with shipmates and sometimes
alone, saw about all there was to be seen
of the old city which, in the month of July, fortunately
unaware of the destruction and death that
was to be her portion a few months later, was
bright and cheerful in spite of all the war activities
within and about her. The <i>Gyandotte</i> took
on coal one day and Nelson had his first experience
of the joys of such a job. After the bunkers
were filled, the coal being handled aboard the
<i>Gyandotte</i> in bags by hand, every speck of coal
dust had to be washed away, and that was a
task almost as difficult as loading. But at last the
job was done, though the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> men didn’t
threaten the Navy record that time, and soiled
dungarees were pulled off and baths were in order.
For the first time Nelson realized the advisability
of winning speedy promotion, for petty officers
didn’t have to carry bags of coal across a canvas
covered deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>They were to have started on again after three
days at Halifax, but one of the submarines had
managed to get an engine out of commission and
repairs required another day, so that it was just
after sunset on the fourth evening that underwater
craft and convoys pulled up hooks and
turned noses seaward again. British and French
flags dipped as they passed out of the harbor and
from one of the warships came the strains of the
American anthem, in response to which the departing
Jackies cheered and waved. Devil’s Island
Light blinked farewell to them and they
steamed away into the ocean lane, one more contribution
to the cause of Justice and Humanity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<small>OVERBOARD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Some twenty-five hundred miles lay before
them, which meant from five to six days
at sea, depending on weather and other
fortunes. On the <i>Gyandotte</i> it was pretty unanimously
the opinion that the submarines had
tackled a “man’s job,” and that those aboard them
were “regular fellows.” For the first two days
it was customary to ask of a morning: “Have
we still got ’em all?” But the subs themselves
appeared to neither ask nor expect sympathy.
They went at their task with a fine nonchalance,
plowing along sturdily and steadily at some
twelve knots an hour, sometimes hidden from
sight beyond the seas that tumbled them, always
dripping from end to end. The bridges invariably
held one or more rubber-clad forms swaying
up and down, back and forth, behind the scant
protection of the canvas weather shields. It was
a gallant little band, and those on the larger ships
were proud of them and, while never losing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
chance to make fun of them, would have fought
on the instant had anyone so much as hinted that
those submarine officers and men weren’t the pluckiest
chaps in the service.</p>

<p>The usual fog met them off the Banks and the
summer weather that had accompanied them up
the coast gave place to chill days and chillier
nights. On the morning of the third day at sea
the fog blew away before a strong northeast wind
and they had stormy sunlight until well toward
evening. By that time there was talk of dirty
weather ahead, and the prediction was verified
before midnight. At six bells the <i>Gyandotte</i> was
plunging and shaking, while a freshening gale
threw whole seas aboard her and seemed to be
trying to blow her back where she had come from.
The cruiser made hard going of it, showing a
nasty disposition to stick her nose under the seas
rather than through them. Everything was afloat
forward of amidships. Word came presently
from the flagship to reduce speed to ten knots, and
later it was still further reduced. There was
much anxiety as to the submarines and in the
<i>Gyandotte’s</i> forecastle many a head was shaken
commiseratingly that night. The gale increased
rather than lessened toward morning and when
daylight came it showed a world of mountainous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
seas and leaden sky. But it also showed fourteen
submarines still in sight, although badly out
of position. At least, so Nelson was told. Personally
he could see but one or two from the
<i>Gyandotte</i>, and those only occasionally. Watching
the nearer one, a half-mile off the port bow,
he shuddered as the tiny gray thing pitched and
tossed and rolled and he tried to think what life
inside her must be at such a time. And yet that
furtive desire still lurked at the back of his consciousness,
the desire to cast his lot with those
heroic lads. Toward evening, though, the wish
was less well defined, for Nelson discovered to
his surprised dismay that he was just about half
seasick. He had thought himself quite through
with such foolishness and was not a little disgusted
and ashamed and went to all sorts of
lengths to prevent his shipmates from suspecting
his condition. He need not have troubled so
much, however, for there were older and more
experienced men aboard that day who moved
about with a greenish pallor and sad eyes. He
put his will to it and refused to be beaten, with
the result that, after a miserable attempt to eat
some supper, merely for the sake of appearances,
he felt better and when he went on watch was
able to look the tumbling seas in the face without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
quailing. The gale subsided toward night, but
the ocean didn’t appear to know it and kept right
on being cantankerous, perhaps because it was
aware, as those in the plunging ships were not,
that the gale’s reformation was but temporary.</p>

<p>At seven bells Nelson was on lookout duty, a
life-vest strapped around his body and everything
but his face hidden by rubber garments. His
station was near the waist and, fortunately or unfortunately,
according to one’s view of subsequent
events, on the starboard. Behind him, affording
partial shelter from wind and flying spray, arose
one of the high funnels, while, above him, a whale-boat,
one of the few small boats carried in time
of war, lurched against the gloom of the sky.
Occasionally he caught the faint glow of a dimmed
stern light somewhere ahead, but for the rest the
darkness was unrelieved. The night was chill,
but he was warmly dressed under his slicker and
felt no discomfort from cold. What was uncomfortable
was the spray that flew slanting along
and across the deck from the big waves that battered
the ship’s port bow. When a more than
usually big sea came aboard the spray rattled
against him like hail and the water came swashing
about his feet, ankle deep, on its way to the scuppers.
That was at half-past eleven, and for some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
ten minutes before that he had fancied that the
wind, which had moderated earlier, was becoming
fiercer again. Once a sudden hurricane gust sent
him lurching against the pipe rail, tearing his feet
from under him in its fury and leaving him clutching
desperately at a davit. The onslaught had
been so unexpected that it left him gasping for
breath. After that he clung with gloved hands
to the rail.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later he was no longer
in doubt as to the behavior of the wind. It had
swung a few points further north and had redoubled
its fury. The <i>Gyandotte</i> heeled under its
assault until Nelson was flattened against the
rail. Its voice was a roar between the funnels
and a demoniacal shriek in the rigging. Far
above him the wireless aerial whistled shrilly.
The wind was a blast from the icy reaches of the
Greenland Sea and his clutching fingers inside
the wet gloves stiffened and numbed. He was
heartily glad that his relief would come soon and
that he could tuck himself in his hammock, even
though it seemed doubtful that sleep would come
to many that night. The little cruiser was taking
it hard, and no mistake. Steps hurried along the
deck in the darkness behind him and off the starboard
bow signals flashed. It was the flagship’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
blinker at work. Presently it ceased and then
from here and there in the night other white
throbs of light traveled across the hurtling waters.
The <i>Gyandotte’s</i> speed decreased and the
tempest smote Nelson from a new angle. He
knew that it meant that the ships had been ordered
to change their course and run into the
gale. His thoughts sped to the little submarines.
He wondered if they could stay afloat in such a
sea. And then, so suddenly that it had all happened
before the cry of alarm was out of his
throat, a wild gust threw itself upon the ship,
the deck slanted until the boiling water threatened
to engulf it, there was a rending crash behind
the boy, something gigantic felled him and
drove the breath from his body, and he knew
no more.</p>

<p>The period of insensibility was probably brief.
Perhaps less than a minute elapsed from the instant
that <a href="#i_fp112">the big funnel</a>, torn away by the wind,
<a href="#i_fp112">crashed down upon boy</a> and rail, until consciousness
returned to him. When it did he was for
the first brief moment too dazed to realize what
had happened or where he was. It was the icy,
breath-taking coldness that cleared his brain. He
found himself rising through blackness and space,
bruised, gasping, struggling instinctively, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
crash of waters about him and the howl of the
gale.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>He was overboard!</p>

<p>Terror clutched at his heart with fingers colder
than the sea. He shrieked aloud, but the sound
was torn from his lips by the wind. He thrashed
his arms impotently and went down into a great
depth, turning over and over while tons of water
seethed over him with a dull roaring. He fought
for the surface, his garments impeding him but
the life-vest aiding, and presently felt the air in
his nostrils again. His lungs were choked with
the water he had swallowed and he felt horribly
sick. But the first panic of unreasoning fright had
passed and he was able to think, if not calmly, at
least with some clearness. He realized that, horrible
as his condition was, drowning was as yet a
long way off if he could keep his head above water,
for his life-vest would sustain him for days. If
death came it would come from exhaustion, for to
keep air in his lungs would mean a constant struggle
and struggling would soon weary him. The
cold he believed he could stand for some time.
But he had no illusions. He knew that his chance
of being rescued was not one in a hundred, that
even could he hold out until daylight, and the
storm should pass, there might be no ship to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
see him. Realizing the utter hopelessness of his
plight calmed him. Having once accepted the
inevitable, there was no sense in mutiny. He
would live as long as he could. After that—well,
after that one’s troubles were past.</p>

<p>He had worked out of his rubber coat—his
cap was long since gone—and now he struggled
with his sea boots, and presently cast them off.
The buoyance so gained helped wonderfully. His
arms were freer for swimming and his feet no
longer pulled him down. The seas seemed miles
long at times. He was dragged up and up for
whole minutes, the gale shrieking its fury in his
ears, the water dashing itself into his eyes and
mouth and nose, and then held poised for a brief
moment high up between sea and sky and finally
dropped sickeningly down the slant of rushing
water into the next great hollow. All was turmoil
and darkness. It was impossible to keep his head
out of the water more than half the time, for he
was rolled about like a log, and the best he could
do was hold his breath and wait, then fill his
lungs with the icy blast and be thankful. Somewhere
about him were ships, but the nearest might
now be a mile away, and even could he sight one
in the impenetrable darkness those aboard would
never hear his cries. Just to keep on was the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
thing; swim as best he could to keep the cramps
from his muscles, breathe when he might and die
hard.</p>

<p>His mind was unnaturally active. Thoughts
flew through his brain at lightning speed. He
recalled a thousand incidents, visioned them
swiftly and distinctly and passed them on. He
wondered about his father, and sobbed once and
felt terribly alone and weak. He remembered
what he had set out to do a few short months before,
and the war which had taken so much of
his thought vanished to a mere pin-point of unimportance.
Even a world war seemed a puny, silly
thing here in this universe of blackness and storm.
It would go on to its end, whatever that end might
be, and after an interval everything would be
the same as before. Flowers would spring up
over a million graves and a new generation would
run the plowshares across them, and the world
would go on and on endlessly. It was strange and
puzzling. He would not be there and no one
would know or care. His life was just one tiny
drop in a great ocean, and of no more importance.
He wondered why....</p>

<p>“Troy, Nelson A., seaman, lost overboard from
U. S. S. <i>Gyandotte</i>; uncle, Peter Troy, Wonson,
Me.” That’s the way the papers would have it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
There was something woefully uninteresting about
it. He had sometimes imagined his name with
“killed in action” after it, but here was no implication
of heroism. Perhaps he might say that
he had “died in performance of his duty.” He
didn’t know. Anyway, what did it matter, for
there wouldn’t be anyone to tell! Unless, he
reflected the next moment, he could tell his mother.
Nelson believed implicitly in Heaven, but whether
he would get there was another question, he
thought. And even if he did, what would it be
like, and—Oh, it was a terrible jumble! All a
fellow could do was wait and see. And meanwhile
there was a task at hand, which was to get
his head out of water occasionally and make a
fight for it. That was it! He’d go down fighting,
as became an American Navy man! There was
comfort in that thought. It heartened him, and
he struck out more vigorously and shook the brine
from his eyes with new determination. He had
found a reason for keeping up the struggle.</p>

<p>How long he had been in the water he neither
knew nor considered, but it is likely that no more
than a quarter of an hour at most had passed
since he had been hurtled past the broken rail
of the <i>Gyandotte</i>. Sliding over and over, fighting
for breath, down the slope of a sea, his outflung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
hand touched something. He drew it back
instinctively, conscious of a sudden pain in the
numb fingers. Then startled reason sent him
swiftly groping, and in that instant he sensed rather
than saw something beside him, something huge
that flung the waves back in his stinging eyes. His
eager fingers touched again, slid along a hard,
wet surface that offered no hold, and he threw his
head back and shouted with all his strength. And
at the same moment his fingers found a hold, a
tiny recess in the smooth object that was sliding
past him, and they clutched convulsively and he
felt himself being dragged forward through the
welter of wind and water, his arm straining at its
socket and his body pounded against an object as
hard and resisting as a block of stone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<small>TWENTY FATHOMS DOWN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">He knew then that Providence had guided
him to the side of one of the other
ships, that, could he but make himself
heard above the roar of the elements, he might
yet be saved. The realization brought a renewal
of courage. The mere physical contact with something
more solid, more stable than the hungry
waves endowed his aching body with strength.
If he could only hold on! The strain on his
cramped fingers was terrific, and at every roll of
the hull his body was thrown against it with a
violence that must soon bring endurance to an
end. He dashed the salt water from his face
and shouted at the top of his tired lungs. And
then, coming up choking and sputtering from a
wave, again sent his appeal toward the deck.
Surely, he thought, someone must hear him!</p>

<p>He could no longer stand the pain in the hand
and arm that held him to the ship, and with difficulty
he reached his right hand up and set the fingers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
into the narrow crevice and dropped the other
away, numb and aching. This brought his face
to the hull and turned his body so that it lay
closer to the steel plates and was less buffeted.
And the position raised his head further so that
his breathing periods were more frequent. When
his head was above water he shouted, but he began
to lose hope now, for in that confused roar of
wind and water his cries were scarcely audible
to him. His hold was precarious and more than
once he felt his fingers slipping away. Then, by
every effort of weary muscles, pushing against the
smooth surface with his left hand, he regained
his hold. During one such struggle, with head
thrown back and for the instant above the waves,
he blinked the water from his eyes and tried to
pierce the darkness and glimpse the rail far above
him. It must have been some sense other than
sight that told him the truth, for no gloom was
ever more impenetrable and even the hand that
protected his face from the hull was beyond his
vision. But, looking up, he suddenly realized that
there were no towering sides above him, that it
was not a cruiser or destroyer he was clinging to,
but a submarine!</p>

<p>And then something that had puzzled him dimly
was explained. In groping along the hull he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
gained the impression that, instead of bulging
outward as it arose it did the opposite. Now, at
the risk of losing his hold, he sent his left hand
exploring at arm’s length and found instant corroboration.
The hull receded sharply. He realized
then that perhaps no more than another
twelve inches beyond his utmost reach was the
deck. If he could only pull himself up there! But
nothing to grip to, neither protuberance nor recess,
met his searching fingers. Somewhere not very far
distant must be the conning tower and bridge,
and when the next deluge had washed over him
and passed he shouted with a desperation born
of the knowledge of help at hand and of failing
strength. But even as he shouted the thought
came to him that in such weather they would be
navigating the boat from the tightly-closed conning
tower and not from the exposed bridge,
and that no cries he was capable of would penetrate
its steel sides.</p>

<p>He knew that he could not last much longer.
His arm felt as though it was dead, or, to be more
exact, it didn’t feel at all; sensation had quite
passed from it, and it was only by painfully working
a finger that he could be certain that his hand
still clutched the edge of the little crevice. He
was far less reconciled to drowning than he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
been before. The injustice of being thrown into
the path of rescue and then mercilessly denied it
produced a sense of rebellion and even anger.
A few feet away from him, beyond that thin steel
well, men were talking, perhaps laughing, in
warmth and light and comfort, while he was
doomed to perish miserably within arm’s length
of them! A sudden surge of mingled wrath and
terror overcame him, and he rained weak blows
on the hull until his knuckles were torn and bleeding
and the salt set them to stinging, and strove,
as the waves would let him, to knock his knees,
too, against the plates. Then a calmer mood
came, and the hopelessness of further struggle settled
over him. If he abandoned the submarine
he would be no worse off than before save that
he had depleted his strength for swimming. In
one way he would better himself, for drowning
was far less imminent when riding the seas than
while being smothered with the waves that broke
over and against the boat. And, after all, he
had no choice, for he could no longer hold on.
His fingers were slipping fast now and he had
no strength to work them back into place. But,
somehow, having decided, he found it hard to
act. As unfeeling as it had proved, that submarine
was tangible and friendly, and letting go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
would be like releasing one’s hold of a rope to
drop into unknown depths. He compromised with
his decision. He would stay where he was as
long as he could. Time enough to cast adrift
when his fingers no longer performed their task.
He shouted no more now. He only waited and
endured.</p>

<p>Moments passed, and then light beat on his
closed lids and he opened his eyes. A wave hissed
over him, but through it a white glare penetrated.
The water passed, the boat rolled, and,
choking and gasping, his aching body tossed
sprawling against the hull, he heard a voice issue
from the fierce radiance that still engulfed him.
The words were whisked away by the wind. Something
dragged at his free arm and he felt himself
being pulled like a sack of grain up the wet, sloping
side. He experienced neither joy nor relief,
but only a dim wonder. And about that time he
ceased to take further interest in things.</p>

<p>Minutes later he awoke to the knowledge of
something hot and fragrant at his lips and a voice
saying “Drink.” He obeyed and a warm glow
permeated his chilled body. For a brief instant
he opened his eyes wide enough to receive an
impression of a painfully white place that, to a
vision so long accustomed to darkness, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
ablaze with lights. Forms moved hazily. The
air reeked of oil. An appalling tumult assaulted
his ears. The force that held his head up was
removed and he sank back with a sigh and went
to sleep again.</p>

<p>When he next awoke he was still in the white
place and the lights still gleamed, but the noise
had ceased and the smell of oil had given way to
an odor he could not describe even to himself.
And, which was stranger than all, instead of the
pitching and tossing he remembered, the place
where he lay was almost motionless.</p>

<p>Painfully, for he felt weak and dizzy, and every
bone and muscle in his tired body ached, he
stopped gazing at the bottom of the bunk above
him and moved his head so that he could view his
surroundings. He began to remember slowly as
he did so, and by the time he realized his surroundings
the events of the night before were in
orderly sequence. He sighed deeply, and:</p>

<p>“Gee! I’m still alive!” he muttered.</p>

<p>It was a strange place in which he found himself,
but his visit to the submarine in New London
that time enabled him to recognize it. He was
lying in one of the lower bunks in the forward battery
compartment which is the men’s quarters.
There were twelve of these bunks in all, six on each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
side, three in a tier. One or two of those opposite
were occupied. An iron ladder led from the
floor to a closed hatch above. Everything was
painted white and sweated moisture. A table disputed
the center of the compartment with the ladder
and about it four men, in soiled and greasy
dungarees, were seated. Further aft a sixth man
was in evidence. He was drawing coffee at a
steaming urn, and Nelson knew him for the cook.
There was an electric range beside him, and,
opposite, food lockers. Beyond the galley end
of the compartment a watertight door stood open,
revealing a vista of further compartments. Everywhere
ran pipes and wires, with a multitude of
valves and switches. The odor which had puzzled
him at first now yielded certain recognizable
ingredients: hot coffee and food; battery fumes;
moist clothing.</p>

<p>He was beneath a cover of two gray blankets.
They had removed his outer clothing and it lay,
half dried, across his feet. He sniffed longingly
at the coffee streaming from the faucet of the
shining urn, and when, after a moment, the cook
approached the table with three aluminum cups
of it in hand, he found his voice.</p>

<p>“May I have some, please?” he asked weakly.</p>

<p>The cook, a lad not much Nelson’s senior, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
an unmistakable Irish countenance, looked over
his shoulder, and the men at the table craned
their heads.</p>

<p>“Hello, kid!” said the cook. “You comin’ to?
Sure you can have some. All you want, I guess.”</p>

<p>One of the others stepped across to the bunk.
“How are you, Jack?” he asked.</p>

<p>“All right, I think. What boat’s this?”</p>

<p>“<i>Q-4.</i> Where’d you come from?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be bothering the lad with questions,
Terry. He’s down and out, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“I feel pretty fair, thanks,” said Nelson. “I
belong on the <i>Gyandotte</i>. I was on lookout last
night—is it morning now?” The man nodded.
“Last night it was, then. Something happened.
Maybe a boat blew off the davits. Anyway, I
went overboard. After awhile I caught hold
of this boat and hung on. I shouted, but I thought
you didn’t hear me. Then someone flashed a light
and I woke up down here. That’s about all.”</p>

<p>“And it’s plenty, kid! You were all in when
they grabbed you. How long were you in the
water?”</p>

<p>“How does he know?” asked one of the others
with deep disgust. “Suppose he looked at his
watch and timed himself? Sit down here, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
chuckle-head, and sop up your coffee and leave the
lad be.”</p>

<p>“Out o’ my way, Terry!” The cook thrust a
cup of coffee into Nelson’s hand and added sugar.
“Kid,” he said, “you won the long-distance rough-and-tumble
record last night, all right! One of
you fellows tell the luff the boy’s awake. He
wants to speak to him.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, Cookie! Cut some more bread while
I’m gone, will you?” One of the men arose and
disappeared through the after door. Nelson
propped himself on an elbow and stirred his
coffee.</p>

<p>“The storm’s all over, isn’t it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Is it, then?” said the cook. “You wouldn’t
think so if you was up above. It was blowin’
about seventy when we left.”</p>

<p>“Left? Oh, you mean that you’ve submerged?”</p>

<p>“You bet you! We’ve been down nearly four
hours now. I’ve seen a few rough nights in my
short but eventful life, kid, but last night had ’em
all beat! We was shufflin’ around here like dice
in a box. How you ever lived in the water is
what gets me!”</p>

<p>“How far down are we? Are we sitting on the
bottom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Sitting on the bot—say, where do you think
you are? New York harbor? There ain’t no
bottom here, or if there is it would take a day
to find it! We’re a hundred and twenty feet under,
or were an hour ago, and we’re doing about
four knots.”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” exclaimed Nelson in awed tones. “A
hundred and twenty feet below the surface! Isn’t
that a lot?”</p>

<p>“It ain’t too much in this rumpus, kid, believe
me! Have some coffee? I’d give you some hash,
but they said you wasn’t to eat till the luff seen
you. Here he comes now.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant was a man of about thirty-two
or -three years of age, short, squarely-built,
bearded, round of face and dressed in a stained
uniform whose gold braid was dulled and discolored.
He had a gruff voice and an all-enveloping
smile.</p>

<p>“Hello, Neptune!” he greeted. “All ready to
go back where you belong, are you? We’re going
to shoot you out a tube in a minute.”</p>

<p>“No, sir.” Nelson saluted weakly, and smiled.
“Not quite yet, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, how are you feeling? And where in
the name of common sense did you come from?”</p>

<p>“I’m sort of tired, sir, that’s all. I went overboard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
from the <i>Gyandotte</i>. Something broke
loose on deck and struck me and first thing I knew
I was in the water.”</p>

<p>“Pleasant experience! Go ahead and finish
your coffee.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough, sir, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Feeling hungry?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not a bit.”</p>

<p>“Just as well. We’ll feed you up later. Don’t
know how soon we’ll be able to land you back on
your ship, though. If this gale keeps on we’ll be
down some time. What kept you from drowning?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. I had a life-vest on, of
course. After I’d been floating around awhile
my hand struck against this boat and found a sort
of hole——”</p>

<p>“Scupper, probably. How long were you hanging
on before we got you?”</p>

<p>Nelson frowned and shook his head. “I don’t
know. It seemed a long time, but I don’t think
it could have been more than a quarter of an
hour.”</p>

<p>“Great Scot! Who was it heard the knocking?
You, Clancy, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Brainard heard it, too. I thought
we were scraping a mine. I wouldn’t have heard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
it only I was in my bunk, and it’s a top one, and
the knocks were right alongside my head.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he fell out in a hurry, sir!” chuckled
the man called Terry. “He did it in the quickest
time I ever saw!”</p>

<p>“So would you have if you’d heard it,” growled
Clancy. “I thought sure we were making friends
with a floating mine and I didn’t want to be so
close to it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame you!” laughed the lieutenant.
“Lucky for this man we’re a single-huller and that
you heard it, though. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Troy, sir; seaman, second class, Reserve.”</p>

<p>“Reserve, eh? Well, there’s hope for the Reserves
if they’re all like you, Troy. You have
luck, my boy, and that’s better than being born
rich. Mix him up some gruel in an hour or so,
Cook, and make him take it. We’ll put you
aboard your ship the first chance there is, Troy,
but you’ll have to make the best of us for awhile.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I—I’d like to—that is, I
mean I’m awfully grateful to you for taking care
of me, sir. I guess I’d have been a goner by
this time if you hadn’t pulled me aboard.”</p>

<p>“I guess you would have,” rejoined the lieutenant
dryly. “Don’t see how you stuck it out as
long as you did. You’ll never die by drowning,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
young Neptune! Those your duds there? Why
aren’t they dried? Can’t you hang these in front
of the stove somehow, Cook? He will want
something to put on when he gets up. Here,
Clancy, you take charge of this man. See that
he’s fed and has dry clothing. When he gets up
give him something to do to earn his passage.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant nodded, frowned, smiled, and
strode back to the central station.</p>

<p>Clancy, a red-haired youth of twenty-four or
so, rating as a first class machinist’s mate, forthwith
took over his duties. He viewed Nelson
severely, standing beside the bunk with legs spread
wide and oil-stained hands on his hips.</p>

<p>“Now then, Mr. Neptune, you heard the luff’s
words, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Nelson nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>“What you grinning about? Respect is what
I’ll have from you, my son, and a lot of it!
Don’t you know better than to grin at your superior
officer? What sort of manners do they teach
you in the Naval Reserve? Stow that grin, I tell
you, and look respectful!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” responded Nelson demurely. The
petty officer grunted.</p>

<p>“That’s better. Now then, hungry?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“Good thing you ain’t. You wouldn’t get anything
fit to eat on this boat, anyway. Just the
same there’ll be some gruel for you pretty soon if
the cook don’t forget it or fall asleep. Now then,
Cookie, look alive with the young gentleman’s
wearing apparel! Oh, you’ve got it, have you?”</p>

<p>“I have; and as to fallin’ asleep, believe me,
Clancy, I ain’t never fallen asleep standin’ on
my two feet like you do most of the time.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? One of your feet would be big
enough, without using the other at all. When
those clothes are dry, you’d better get into ’em,
Mr. Neptune, and then feed your face with some
gruel—if you can eat it, which I misdoubt. Then
report to me in the engine room. Get that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” Clancy viewed him with a fierce
scowl, dropped one eyelid in a portentous wink
and swung himself out.</p>

<p>Only the cook was left now, save for the occupants
of one or two bunks who stirred uneasily
in their sleep. The cook had improvised a clothes
line above the electric stove and Nelson’s things
were already gently steaming.</p>

<p>“Wet clothes is against the rules entirely,” observed
the cook cheerfully. “But if the luff passes
’em it’s not for me to be kickin’. Now I’ll start<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
that gruel for you, Nep, but I don’t know what
it’ll be like, for I never made none!”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” murmured Nelson. “I’m
not hungry.”</p>

<p>“Makes no difference. If the luff says you eat,
you eat if it kills you.”</p>

<p>Nelson digested that in silence a moment.
Then: “How many are there aboard here?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Three officers and twenty-one men. And one
fresh young Reservist,” he added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>“Meaning me? If you call me fresh I’ll report
to Clancy that your gruel’s no good.”</p>

<p>“Clancy? That club-footed, knock-kneed galoot!
Much I care about Clancy. Where’s that
package o’ oatmeal I had once? Gruel on a submarine!
They’ll be askin’ for asparagus and artichokes
next!”</p>

<p>A new party of men entered, three capable looking
youngsters not much older than Nelson, and
only removing their sea-boots, climbed into bunks.
They viewed Nelson with a sort of tired interest,
but asked no questions. In something less than
three minutes as many new and assorted snores
were added to the symphony. Occasionally a
sailor passed through toward the bow, or hurried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
aft again. The sound of voices traveling from
the compartments further back reached Nelson as
from an underground passage. There was only
a slight motion perceptible, a queer lunging and
rolling combined that was quite new to anything
he had before experienced. Save for the sound of
voices and the musical efforts of the sleeping men
and Cookie’s muttered apostrophes to the simmering
gruel, the boat was oddly still. Once when
someone far forward in the engine compartment
dropped a wrench the clatter was startling. The
atmosphere was close, but Nelson found no inconvenience
in breathing. Something, and he
thought it might be the air, made him strangely
sluggish and sleepy, and he was on the point of
dozing off again when he heard from beside his
bunk a startled exclamation:</p>

<p>“For the love of Mike! See who’s here!”</p>

<p>Opening his eyes he looked up into the astounded
face of Martin Townsend.</p>

<small>IN THE SUBMARINE “Q-4”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Nelson couldn’t remember having ever
been so glad to see anyone as he was
to see the lad who, his surprise turning
to pleasure, thrust a brown and not over-clean
hand toward the bunk. He had been many
times pretty lonesome since leaving the <i>Wanderer</i>,
and the fact came to him as he seized the proffered
hand and gripped it hard. Martin Townsend’s
laughter rang out gayly as he seated himself
precariously on the edge of the bunk, and
Nelson found himself joining in for no very apparent
reason. Somehow, finding Townsend
again was like finding an old friend, even though
they had been together but a little over an hour
in all their lives!</p>

<p>What happened after that is easily imagined.
Martin took possession of Nelson and, standing
by while he dressed himself in his togs which
were as dry as they were likely to get in an atmosphere
that would have discouraged a hygrometer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
and a pair of borrowed boots, and superintending
the process of devouring a tin cup of strange oatmeal
gruel, he afterwards bore him off in the direction
of the after battery compartment which,
save for the absence of cooking arrangements
was similar to the corresponding compartment
forward. In the central station Nelson saw Captain
Hale and the junior officer, Lieutenant Morris,
both clear-eyed, lean-faced men well under
thirty years. It was the captain who noted them
as they passed and spoke to Martin.</p>

<p>“Is this the man we picked up, Townsend?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Captain Hale looked Nelson over with undisguised
interest as the latter paused and saluted.
“What’s your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>Nelson gave the information, and, in reply to
further questions, narrated briefly the story of his
adventures. The junior lieutenant turned from
his post at the gyroscopic compass and listened.</p>

<p>“Sounds like a romance to me, my boy,” laughed
the captain at the end, his gray eyes twinkling.
“Have you tried it on the marines yet?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’ve had no chance,” answered Nelson,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it must be so. You’re pretty
good proof of it. But it beats any story I’ve heard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
yet in the Navy. You’re a mighty lucky fellow
to get out of a scrape like that. What was it like
on the <i>Gyandotte</i> last night?”</p>

<p>“Pretty rough, sir.”</p>

<p>“I guess it was. You know the <i>Gyandotte</i>,
George,” he added, turning to the lieutenant.
“Weren’t you on her once?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was with the <i>Gyandotte</i> five years ago.
It was her last cruise. We thought she wouldn’t
hold together to make port. She’s been overhauled,
though, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Hope so. Well, make yourself at home, Troy.
Townsend will find you something to do perhaps.
We’ll put you back on your ship when we can,
but I don’t know when we’ll see her again.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.” Nelson followed Martin
into the next compartment and was introduced to
two of the crew who were lounging there. Something
in their attitude toward Martin prompted
Nelson to ask, as he seated himself on a bench
beside the other: “Are you a petty officer?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know, old scout!” Martin
laughed. “They made me a gunner’s mate, third
class. Don’t ask me why, though. See that you
treat me properly after this. Now tell me the
whole yarn, Troy. What’s happened to you since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
I saw you last? Did you see me that day on the
river? Where’s your friend Mason?”</p>

<p>“Mason? Oh, you mean Masters. Billy’s
still on the <i>Wanderer</i>, I think. I’d be there yet,
too, if it hadn’t been for a piece of luck.” Whereupon
Nelson told of his meeting on the train with
the Navy official and his transfer to the <i>Gyandotte</i>.
And that led to the battle off Bermuda
with the <i>Mahlow</i>. Martin had to have full details
of that encounter and was disappointed by
the colossal ignorance displayed by the narrator.
“You see,” explained Nelson, “you don’t have
much chance to watch things, Townsend, on a gun
crew. You have your hands pretty full and you
can’t see much, anyhow. At least, you can’t if
you’re shellman, because you’re behind the gun all
the time. Most of what I know about that row
came from hearing the other fellows talk afterwards.”</p>

<p>“It must have been great!” sighed Martin.
“Wish I’d been there. Still, I wouldn’t have had
much fun, I guess, since you didn’t try torpedoes
on the Hun. Does the <i>Gyandotte</i> carry tubes?”</p>

<p>“No. How long have you been on this boat?”</p>

<p>“Three weeks. A little over. She’s a dandy,
isn’t she? Have you been over her? Like to
look around?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” responded the other eagerly.
“Lieutenant Somebody—the one with the gruff
voice—told a man named Clancy to take me in
charge, and Clancy told me to report to him
in the engine room. Maybe I’d better, eh?”</p>

<p>“Clancy?” laughed the other. “He’s a fine lad
to have charge of anyone! Come on in here and
we’ll see him.”</p>

<p>The engine room was the next compartment
aft, and they found Clancy alone there engaged
in polishing the bright work of the port engine,
although so far as Nelson could see every inch
of brass or copper or steel was already immaculate.</p>

<p>Clancy’s willingness to be relieved of his responsibility
was so patent as to be almost impolite,
and the two boys went on to the after compartment.
Here were the main motors and the auxiliary
machinery of all kinds. Two men were in
charge there, a petty officer and an oiler. The
low hum of the motors and the faint, slow churn
of the twin propellers alone broke the silence.
Martin explained the mechanism that was driving
the steel cylinder through the depths, once or
twice calling on the electrician for aid. On the
surface, Nelson learned, it was the big Diesel
oil-burning engines that supplied the power, but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
since they depended on a large amount of air for
their performance, it was not possible to use them
when submerged. When ready to sink the Diesels
were stopped and uncoupled from the shafts and
the motors started. These obtained their energy
from storage batteries located beneath the deck
on which they stood. The petty officer in charge
explained the working of the contractor gear by
which the control of the motors is effected in the
central station. The main motors compartment,
like every other section of the submarine, was
painted white and was as clean as a Dutch kitchen.
The electric bulbs flooded the place with light.
The arching sides were crowded with switchboards
and hung with a confusion of cables and
wires.</p>

<p>Returning forward, they passed into the long
compartment at that moment presided over by
the diligent Clancy. The two great engines occupied
every bit of space there save for a central
passage barely wide enough to move through.
Clancy held forth at length and with enthusiasm
on those engines, but Nelson, whose bent of mind
was not mechanical, found it difficult to understand
what was told him. He did get away with one
or two interesting facts, however: as, for instance
that the Diesels burned crude oil instead of kerosene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
or gasoline, at a vast saving, and that instead
of having the charges in the cylinders ignited by
electric sparks, in the only way he had ever heard
of, the engines produced their own heat for ignition
by compression.</p>

<p>“It’s like this,” elaborated Clancy. “These
are four cycle engines, do you see? That is, one
of the pistons does four strokes to one explosion
of the charge, two up and two down. Now take
this fellow. When the piston in this cylinder goes
down it draws a lot of air into the cylinder after
it. When it goes up again it compresses that
air something fierce; about five hundred pounds
to the square inch. That heats the air, do you
see, to something like a thousand degrees. Next
oil is sprayed into the cylinder by compressed air,
and when it hits that hot air already there it lights.
That’s what they call combustion, and that sends
the piston down again and turns the shaft over.
That’s the third stroke. The fourth is the next
up-stroke and that pushes the burnt gases out, and
there you are!”</p>

<p>Nelson shook his head. “It sounds all right,”
he said, “but what makes the engine start first of
all?”</p>

<p>“The storage batteries.”</p>

<p>“And how fast will they drive the boat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“Sixteen knots at a pinch, but we usually do
twelve on account of using too much fuel at
high speed. You got to think of fuel, you know.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. And where do you keep that?”</p>

<p>“Everywhere.” Clancy waved a big hand
vaguely. “There’s tanks of it all over. The
main tanks are fore and aft, next to the keel, but
we’ve smaller ones here and there. There isn’t
any space wasted on one of these contraptions,
Nep.”</p>

<p>“Why did he call you Nep?” asked Martin curiously
as they went on. Nelson explained and his
friend chuckled. “That’s not so bad, either.
Guess I’ll have to call you that, too. This we
call the after quarters, but technically it’s the after
battery compartment. About half the storage
batteries are underfoot here. You can see the
cables leading forward there. These gratings lift
up when you want to get at the cells. That’s my
bunk there. Those cupboards are where we stow
our gear. Next is the central station. Can’t
show you around there, though, for the Old Man
doesn’t like us hanging about. Everything’s controlled
from there, you see.”</p>

<p>They paused inside the door and looked
through into the next compartment. There were
nine persons there, the captain and first officer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
and seven men. It was quite a spacious chamber,
as it needed to be in order to accommodate all
those necessary to navigate the boat under water.
A ladder led upward to the conning tower above
and a bench ran along one side, but for the rest
the furnishings of the central station were all
mechanical. Dials, valves, gyroscope compass,
manifolds, steering and diving wheels, depth
gauges, levers, clinometer for determining the
boat’s inclination, motor controllers, engine room
telegraph, navigating lights, voice pipes and other
things were indicated by Martin. Here was the
brain of the craft. Every activity was controlled
from this white-walled, light-flooded chamber and
from it wires and pipes led forward and aft like
nerves. Two gunner’s mates were at the big
brass wheels controlling the diving rudders, while
in front of them a gauge indicated the boat’s depth.
Their duty, explained Martin, was to keep the
submarine on an even keel, and at the depth ordered
by the navigating officer, by means of the
forward and aft diving rudders. Near them a
mechanic presided over the air and water manifolds
of the ballast and trimming tanks. A fourth
man was in charge of the Kingston valves which
flooded the main ballast tanks during submergence.
A steersman was at the wheel to the left of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
forward door and two electricians stood by the
Number Two periscope ready for duty. The
place was a white vault of shining machinery that
made no noise in which the quiet conversation of
the two officers was strangely distinct.</p>

<p>Martin led the way through to the forward
battery compartment where some half-dozen of
the crew were at rest in their bunks or seated
about the table. The cook was busy at the electric
range, for the hour, as Nelson had seen by the
clock in the central station, was close on ten.
Martin exchanged remarks with the fellows
around the table and led the way aft to another
watertight door. Passing through this, Nelson
found himself in the wireless room, a small compartment
at present holding one man, who, with
a telephone receiver strapped to his head, was
listening at the Fessenden Oscillator, or submarine
signal apparatus. The compartment was a
maze of wires, meters, switches, coils and other
electrical contrivances. Beyond the wireless room
were small staterooms occupied by the officers.
They were tiny bare white-walled cells containing
little more than a bunk, a chest of drawers, a
small writing desk and a lavatory each. Beyond
the open door of one Nelson glimpsed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
gruff-voiced first lieutenant who had dubbed him
Neptune.</p>

<p>“Here’s where I live when I’m on duty,” said
Martin as they passed through still another door
into the bow torpedo compartment. They were
now close to the submarine’s nose and the moisture-studded
roof above was perceptibly nearer
their heads. Facing them were the butts of the
four twenty-one-inch torpedo tubes, each a round
white-enameled bulls-eye at first glance. A second
look, however, showed the bulls-eyes to be
dish-shaped covers on long, curved hinges which,
as Martin explained, were opened by hand to expose
the breeches for loading. On chocks at
each side of the compartment rested eight torpedoes,
which, with those already in the tubes,
made twelve in all. Besides the torpedo tubes the
compartment also held the anchor winches, and
Martin showed how the anchor chains could be
slipped by a simple device in case of fouling.</p>

<p>There were two men in there, busy with oiled
rags when the visitors entered. Martin introduced
them to Nelson and he received a hearty if
somewhat greasy handshake from each. He
found the torpedo compartment more interesting
than any of the others and asked a dozen questions
in as many minutes. Martin was very willing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
to explain everything, his mates throwing in
helpful interpolations. (It was evident to Nelson
from the way in which these latter viewed him
that he was looked on by the crew of the <i>Q-4</i> as
rather a remarkable individual.)</p>

<p>“Here’s the way it’s done,” began Martin.
“This tube”—laying a hand affectionately on one
of the breeches—“has a watertight cap at the
outer end of it. It can be opened or closed by
turning this little wheel. When we want to load
a tube we close the outer cap first of all. Then
we open this inner cover, like this.” He suited
action to word and Nelson, stooping, peered into
the tube which already held a torpedo. “We roll
one of those torpedoes up and slide it in. This
cover is closed again; you see it has a rubber joint
here which makes it watertight. Then——”</p>

<p>“Prepare for firing, Mart,” suggested one of
the others.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so. I forgot to say that we remove
the safety pin before we load the torpedo,
but you probably know about that. And, of
course, we set the depth gear. That done, we
close this inner cover, so. Next we open this
valve which lets in water from the filling tank.
There’s one of these tanks for each tube, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
each holds just enough water to fill in around the
torpedo.”</p>

<p>“But why not draw the water from the outside?”
asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“Because you’d add about seven hundred
pounds of weight to the boat and start her sinking.
You see, you’ve got to maintain the same stability.
When you fill around the torpedo with water
from the tank you’re not taking on any more
weight, you’re only shifting it from one place to
another, and without changing its longitudinal
position. Get that?” Nelson nodded.</p>

<p>“Then we open the outer cap and we’re ready
for firing. We report Number One or Two, or
whichever it may be, ready over the tube, and the
Old Man just presses a button. Air compressed
to a hundred pounds to the square inch butts in
through here behind the torpedo and out she goes
at thirty knots. Simple, what?”</p>

<p>Nelson smiled. “When you know how. But
look here, Townsend. After you’ve shot your
first torpedo where do you get water from to fill
the tube around the next one? Your tank’s empty,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Right-o! But listen to me, old settler. When
your ‘moldie’ leaves the tube the water flows into
it. The weight of that water is only a few hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
pounds less than the weight of the torpedo
and water together was before. So next thing
we do we close the outer cap again. Then we
pump seven hundred pounds of that water back
into the filling tank. After that we blow the rest
of the water in the tube into what’s called the compensating
tank. Now, then, we’ve still got the
same weight aboard as we had before we parted
with Mr. Torpedo. Do I make myself plain?”</p>

<p>“Quite, thanks. It—it’s rather wonderful, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s ingenious. I’ll say that much for
it. After all the water is out we open this inner
breech again and we’re all ready to slip in another
torpedo. And that’s how <em>that’s</em> done! Jimmy
here could have doped it out better for you, but
I guess you’ve got the general idea. How’s the
air, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Getting a bit thick, I’d say,” replied the one
alluded to as Jimmy. He sniffed knowingly and
then took a deep breath. “Wonder how it is
on the surface.”</p>

<p>“Blowing like the Old Harry, I guess. When
did we dive? I was asleep.”</p>

<p>“About three-twenty, I think it was. We’re
good for another fifteen or sixteen hours yet,
but I hope he’ll pop up before that. It’s the battery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
smell that gets me. I can taste the stuff
already.”</p>

<p>“Can you really stay down as long as he said?”
asked Nelson as they made their way along the
passage to the after quarters.</p>

<p>“We can stay down as long as our battery
holds out, which at four knots an hour, about
what we’re doing, would be from twenty-two to
twenty-four hours. Anyway, that’s what they
say. I was never down more than four hours until
now. As far as the air is concerned, I guess
no one knows how long this tub could stay down.
I dare say the air would hold out about as long
as the battery, though. That needn’t worry you,
Nep. We’ll be popping out long before that.”</p>

<small>“SURFACE!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dinner was not very tempting to Nelson,
probably because he still felt the effects
of his adventure of the night before.
Besides, he had eaten nearly a pint of Cookie’s
remarkable oatmeal gruel, which had been like no
other gruel Nelson had ever tasted. The meal
consisted of beef stew and potatoes, bread, pudding
and tea. While the variety was not great,
there was plenty of everything. During the meal
Nelson got better acquainted with the crew of the
<i>Q-4</i>. They averaged, he guessed, about twenty-two
years of age, although one or two were apparently
no older than he and several were in
the thirties. He very soon learned that, just as
the destroyer men looked down on the men of the
battleships as mollycoddles, so the submarine men
viewed the destroyer crews with pitying contempt.
There was a good deal of interest betrayed in
the fortunes of the other subs, one or two of which
were very small boats and, in the opinion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
<i>Q-4’s</i> men, not able to look after themselves in
a storm like the present. There was also much
speculation as to whether the companion boats had
“run it out” or dived. Nelson gathered that each
commander had been free to follow his judgment
as to submerging. One or two of the others were
known to have left the surface and communication
had been held with one by means of the submarine
telegraph during the morning.</p>

<p>After dinner Martin went on duty in the torpedo
compartment, taking Nelson with him. The
latter spent nearly two hours there, busied part of
the time wiping, while Martin went over the mechanism
of a torpedo and delivered a lecture on
the missile. Nelson was initiated into the mysteries
of the tiny four-cylinder engine, the automatic
steering device and the depth gear. In fact,
by the time Martin had finished his discourse
Nelson could have passed an examination on the
subject of the Bliss-Leavitt torpedo very creditably.
Martin informed him that the nose contained
three hundred pounds of TNT or trinitrotoluol,
and after that Nelson treated the business
ends of the torpedoes with great respect, although
Martin assured him that until the butterfly nut on
the protruding tip of the firing pin was off there
was no danger. This nut looked like a miniature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
propeller, having wings that caused it to turn in
the water and so release the locking gear of the
firing pin. A second safety device was a bolt
passing from the outside of the war head to the
firing pin to prevent the latter being moved back
against the percussion cap. Behind the war head
was the compressed air tank by which the propeller
at the tail was rotated. When Martin
remarked that the air chamber was at the moment
charged with 2,250 pounds of air Nelson began
to wonder if the war head was, after all, the more
dangerous part of the thing! He sincerely hoped
that the steel wells were equal to that pressure
of over a ton to each square inch! The balance
chamber mechanism was a bit too much for Nelson,
although Martin patiently tried to make him
understand the functions of the gyroscope and
the pendulum control. In the end Nelson mastered
the reason for those devices, but he was
hazy as to why they performed the remarkable
stunts attributed to them!</p>

<p>Martin stopped lecturing before he became tiresome
and the two boys talked of less technical
things, one of them being home. Perhaps it would
be more exact to say that Martin talked about
his home and Nelson listened. Nelson’s home just
then had few attractions for him as a matter for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
discourse. They became very well acquainted that
afternoon, and by supper time Nelson, for his
part, felt as if the acquaintance was of years’
standing. Possibly there is something in being
in a watertight cylinder a hundred or more feet
below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean that expedites
friendship! At all events, the two boys
got along fast, and Nelson, who had never had a
real chum of anywhere near his own age, was
quite breathlessly happy. The afternoon flew by
and it was “grub time” again. Nelson’s appetite
was fifty per cent better than at noon. They had
“submarine turkey” for supper, a viand better
known to Nelson as canned salmon, and bread and
butter and apple-sauce—also canned—and enough
coffee to float the boat. The big coffee urn was
always simmering and always on tap, and the
amount of the beverage that was consumed during
twenty-four hours aboard the <i>Q-4</i> was awe-inspiring.
Some of the men seldom passed the
galley that they didn’t stop and pour a cupful
of it down their throats. And, or so Nelson
thought, it wasn’t awfully good coffee at that!</p>

<p>By six bells the air in the submarine had become
rather foul, and one noticed it by an increased
drowsiness and an irritated condition of
eyes and throat. In the quarters they began to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
speak of going up, and it seemed to Nelson that
several of the men showed a distinct uneasiness,
while many who should have been in their bunks
remained up. Nelson found his eyes closing several
times and had to move about to throw off the
sleepiness that was creeping over him. About
half an hour later there was a sudden inclination
of the submarine as she began to rise. The sensation
was a novel one to Nelson and he cast an
alarmed look at Martin.</p>

<p>“Going up,” said the latter reassuringly. “Come
have a look.”</p>

<p>They went to the door leading to the central
station and peered through. But save that the
captain was at the motor control and that the other
occupants of the shining, white compartment
looked more alert, the scene was no different than
earlier. A petty officer in front of the depth gauge
said distinctly:</p>

<p>“Eighty-five, sir.”</p>

<p>There was silence again. It seemed to Nelson
that there was a more perceptible hum from the
end of the passage where the motors were. The
slant from bow to stern was slight, but you
realized it when you walked, and there was a different
motion to the boat, less a roll than a queer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
side sway. The captain moved a lever in front
of him gently.</p>

<p>“Sixty, sir!” announced the officer at the gauge.</p>

<p>“Hold her at fifty,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Ay-y-y, sir!”</p>

<p>The men at the diving rudder controls moved
imperceptibly.</p>

<p>“Fifty-seven! Fifty-five! Fifty-three!”</p>

<p>The captain swung the lever again. The sensation
of climbing upward passed and the submarine
rode on an even keel, the men at the wheels
turning them slowly, their eyes on the indicators.
The <i>Q-4</i> was in less quiet water now, for she
swung sidewise and dipped fore and aft. The
first officer spoke across the compartment.</p>

<p>“Still at it up there.”</p>

<p>The captain nodded, peered at the gyroscopic
compass and turned about. “We’ll give her another
three hours, I think. Pass the word for all
hands off watch to bunk in and get some sleep.”</p>

<p>Nelson climbed into his bunk, after removing
boots and jacket, which was as much as any of
the others took off, and did his best to get to sleep.
But, although he couldn’t keep his eyes open save
by an effort, sleep was elusive. He finally fell
into a sort of doze during which he was more
than half aware of movement and sound about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
him and of the unquiet swinging of the boat. He
felt much as he had felt once several years before
when a dentist had given him gas to extract a
tooth, sort of half here and half there, as he expressed
it to himself. He dreamed ridiculous
things, although he would have declared afterwards
that he had not been enough asleep to
dream. One vivid nightmare, in which he was
astride a torpedo and shooting along the surface
of the water at something like a mile a minute
making straight for the towering side of the biggest
dreadnought that human imagination had
ever visioned, brought him awake with a yelp of
terror.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so,” said a sleepy voice from across
the passage.</p>

<p>The clock in the central station said <em>ting-ting,
ting-ting, ting!</em> Relieved to find that it really
wasn’t so, Nelson settled his head in the crook of
his arm again and again closed his eyes. But just
as drowsiness was stealing back he heard from
beyond the door the short command: “Rise!”</p>

<p>It didn’t refer to him, of course, but he obeyed
it, curiosity getting the better of sleepiness. There
was a sound of rushing air and water as the tanks
were blown. He tumbled out of the bunk and stole
to the door, doing the last few steps uphill as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
submarine began its climb toward the surface.
He was sensible of increased speed. There was a
new man at the depth gauge, a gunner’s mate, and
he was calling off the depths in a gruff voice:</p>

<p>“Forty!... Thirty!... Twenty!...”</p>

<p>Every instant the boat rolled more and more
and Nelson clutched the side of the bulkhead to
keep his feet.</p>

<p>“Raise Number Two periscope!”</p>

<p>“Ten!... Five!”</p>

<p>“Surface!”</p>

<p>Instantly a terrific jar and clatter broke forth
as the Diesels took up the task. The submarine
wallowed and plunged and quivered. The sudden
change from silence to pandemonium was nerve-shattering
and appalling. Nelson could hear the
seas thunder down on the steel deck and rush
off, leaving the submarine staggering. The air
already reeked of oil. The first officer hurried
up the ladder to the conning tower, followed by a
seaman. The captain, who had been peering into
the eye-piece of the periscope, swinging it to all
points of the compass, turned away.</p>

<p>“Conning tower hatch,” he ordered.</p>

<p>A response came from above, and an instant
later Nelson felt the refreshing air that blew down
into the foul depths. The first officer descended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
again, a precarious proceeding with the little craft
trying her best to turn upside down.</p>

<p>“Wind about forty, I think, and a bad sea. I
could see nothing up there.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” replied the captain. He picked up
the mouthpiece of a voice tube. “Collins? Try
to get the flagship, please. Stiles, code our position
and ask for orders. Report that we’re recharging
batteries and shall submerge again in
about four hours.”</p>

<p>Nelson pulled his boots on with difficulty, rocking
about on the bunk, and had just succeeded
when Martin climbed down from above like a
monkey, yawning and blinking, to subside at Nelson’s
side.</p>

<p>“We’re up, aren’t we?” he inquired sleepily.
“Fine little sea on, I must say. We’ll have four
or five hours of this now while they make juice.
Oh, gee, why did I ever leave home?” He yawned
dismally. “This thing of being a bloomin’ hero
isn’t what it’s cracked up to be, Nep. Listen to
that! Sometimes I wish this old sardine can had
a double hull! Wouldn’t you think those seas
meant to come right on in and sit in your lap?
Well, no more sleep while we’re dancing around
up here, that’s sure and certain! Say, wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
it be a bully night to get a torpedo square under
the conning tower?”</p>

<p>“Would a torpedo run straight in such a sea?”
asked Nelson practically.</p>

<p>“Search me! I suppose not, though. Still, if
a U-boat came close enough and aimed at our
broadside—<em>Bang!</em> Good night, everybody!”</p>

<p>“But there aren’t any U-boats way over here,
are there?”</p>

<p>“Probably not, though we aren’t so far out of
the zone after all. If you could always tell where
those sneaking critters kept themselves everything
would be easy. They’ve got a cute way of being
where you don’t expect them, Nep. Thank goodness,
we’re getting air in here at last. It was sort
of fierce when I went by-low.”</p>

<p>“Are they recharging the batteries now?” asked
Nelson.</p>

<p>“Suppose so. They’d better be if they aren’t,
because first thing anyone knows one of these little
ripples will bust in a few plates and we’ll be
exceedingly wet! Let’s go through and get some
coffee.”</p>

<p>Martin didn’t trouble to pull his boots on, but
shuffled, staggering along, to the forward quarters.
Most of the men off duty were already
there, which, since a submarine operating on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
surface requires but few men to handle her,
means that the forward battery compartment was
crowded from bulkhead to bulkhead. Nelson and
Martin plumped in amongst them, stumbling over
a confusion of legs, and subsided on the edge of
a bunk whose occupant, sprawled fully dressed
therein, only grunted as they collided with his
ribs. Two or three of the men were singing, although
their voices were scarcely to be heard
above the roar of the engines and riot of the seas,
and the cook, looking rather sleepy, leaned against
the stove and strummed imaginary music from a
sauce-pan.</p>

    <div class="verse indent1">I know now that <em>Dad was right</em>!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Aw, cut it!” begged a miserable voice from
an upper bunk.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tim! What cheer?” cried a facetious
youth below. There was no reply to the challenge.</p>

<p>“We’ll all be like that if we stay up here much
longer,” grumbled a tall youth with an incipient
mustache and a smear of grease across one cheek.
“Say, where are we, anyhow, fellows? How
much further is it to where we get off?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“About fifteen hundred miles,” answered someone
consolingly. “Or it was before we got blown
all over the shop. Bet you we aren’t any nearer
Ireland than we were this time yesterday!”</p>

<p>“Thought we were going to Queenstown,” said
another.</p>

<p>“So we are, you chump. Where do you think
Queenstown is?”</p>

<p>“France, of course! Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>There was a laugh at that, and he was informed
that unless Ireland had had another Big Wind
Queenstown was still across the Channel from
France. Nelson began to feel squirmy after
awhile and, seeing that Martin was half-asleep,
propped up against the bunk frame, he unobtrusively
picked his way through the crowd, aware
of surreptitious smiles, and made his way back to
his bunk, narrowly missing a collision with the
junior lieutenant on the way.</p>

<p>The next few hours were most unhappy ones
for Nelson. He was just sick enough to be miserable,
and for a long time his efforts to get to
sleep were vain. He finally fell into a restless
slumber, however, from which he was later awakened
by a swirling and rushing of water beneath
him, followed after a minute by a gurgling sound
that proclaimed the main tanks filled. He waited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
for the engines to stop their racket, but, waiting,
he fell asleep again, and when he next awoke the
silence was for a moment quite startling.</p>

<p>“Down again,” he murmured comfortably.
“Fine! Nice and quiet!”</p>

<p>Then he really and truly went to sleep.</p>

<small>IN AN IRISH MIST</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The <i>Q-4</i> slid down a long foam-patterned
wave that hid the horizon behind, wallowed
a moment in the green hollow and
began her climb once more. Those seas were awe-inspiring,
and Nelson, viewing them from a conning
tower port, felt that the submarine was a
ridiculously tiny thing to be afloat in. Even Martin,
who had preceded him up the ladder, looked
a bit serious as he raised his eyes to the crest of
the next monster that came, towering far against
a stormy gray sky, toward them as if to engulf
the little craft. But the <i>Q-4</i> kept on climbing, her
decks aslant, until she seemed to hang motionless
there between sky and water. Then, with a
flirt of her tail, she was off again, coasting down
for another wallow in the trough.</p>

<p>She had been doing that ever since the evening
before when the peaceful quiet of the hundred foot
depth had given place to the clatter and clang
of surface steaming. The gale was a thing of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
past, but the effect of it was still apparent in the
monstrous seas that came charging out of the
north-east. Once during the forenoon the sun had
peered out for a brief moment from behind the
wrack of leaden clouds, but now the world visible
from the <i>Q-4</i> was gray and somber slatey-green.
The other ships were not in sight, for each had
fought the gale in its own way and set its own
course, but the wireless had picked up one of the
destroyers the night before. She had had her
bow bent by a sea and lost a funnel, but was
keeping on about sixty miles north. Later the
<i>Q-4</i> got into communication with the flagship and
with two submarines. Each reported having had
a hard time of it. One of the smaller subs was
believed to have been lost. (That, however, as
they were to learn weeks later, was not so. She
had submerged early in the trouble, but her batteries
had been quickly exhausted and she had
been forced to the surface again where for two
days she had been tossed about and driven so far
from her course that, engine trouble developing,
she had limped in to Bermuda, by that time her
nearest port!) The <i>Q-4</i> was doing eleven knots
and had been putting the miles behind her at that
speed ever since coming up, and, with the barometer
acting reasonably there seemed a fair chance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
of reaching Queenstown in the course of another
three days, for the <i>Q-4</i> had also got too far
south.</p>

<p>Over Nelson’s head, on the swaying bridge, the
junior luff and a steersman were “taking her
through.” Here in the conning tower, behind
the head-high ports, two lookouts were on duty,
scanning the tumbling sea for “smoke, sail or periscope.”</p>

<p>Nelson and Martin descended to the central
station, the former, at least satisfied to exchange
the uneasy tower deck for the comparative calm
of the torpedo compartment whither he accompanied
Martin. He aided, or tried to aid, in the
duty of inspecting the torpedoes and verifying the
pressure in the air flasks, a daily proceeding.
Afterwards he visited Clancy in the engine room
and asked so many questions, having to shout
to make himself heard, that the machinist’s mate
drove him forth with a wrench. Life aboard was
quite sociable that evening, for there was a game
of pitch in the forward quarters and a tow-headed
electrician produced a mouth organ and played
spiritedly, if out of tune, and all who could make
any sort of a vocal sound tried to sing.</p>

<p>The next day dawned with a smoother sea, and
at about six bells in the forenoon watch they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
sighted smoke and picked up the torpedo boat
destroyer <i>Stacey</i>. They were in the German submarine
zone and the watch became sharper than
ever. Just before dark the main body of the
flotilla was sighted and the next morning the
<i>Q-4</i> was back with her companions, some of them
showing effects of their struggles with the storm.
Nelson learned that the <i>Gyandotte</i> was one of the
gray shapes ahead and he wondered whether the
captain would attempt to put him aboard her.
He didn’t quite see the possibility of it, nor did
Martin, and the latter prophesied that Nelson
would stay just where he was until they reached
port, something that Nelson was glad enough to
do. The junior lieutenant informed him that
evening that they had reported his rescue to the
<i>Gyandotte</i>, but that it wouldn’t be advisable to
attempt any transfer at present.</p>

<p>The flotilla was back in two-column formation
by that time, with destroyers and cruisers forming
a cordon about them, and in such order they
steamed toward Cape Clear. The following day
the lookouts on all the ships were kept perturbed
and busy, for the sea was a graveyard thereabouts
and the surface was fairly cluttered with wreckage.
Scarce an hour passed that a floating cask or
spar or hatch did not send the destroyer and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
cruiser gun crews to stations. About noon the
<i>Q-4</i> rode through a patch of oil nearly an acre
in extent. They wanted to think that it was evidence
of a destroyed German submarine, but the
more likely explanation had to do with an Allied
tanker sunk by mine or torpedo. Toward
dusk general quarters was sounded on the <i>Q-4</i>
and the two deck guns were manned and the
torpedo crew flew to their stations. For several
minutes the supposed enemy submarine lay in
plain sight against the sunset glow while the destroyers
converged toward it, three and four-inch
guns popping. Then they swung around and
hurried back in disgust and as the signals wigwagged
from ship to ship the officers on the <i>Q-4’s</i>
bridge chuckled. The submarine had proved to
be a dead whale!</p>

<p>And that was as close to sighting a German
U-boat as they came. For the last two nights of
the run they traveled without even a stern light
and scattered at dark to reassemble at the first
streak of morning. Fastnet Light appeared off
the port bow late that night and when day came,
a misty, soft day, they were carefully picking their
way through the mine fields, with the green hills
of Ireland stretching alongside. And that afternoon
they passed the Head and slowly slipped into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
Cork Harbor, dropping anchors at last under the
slopes of Queenstown.</p>

<p>Back home they never heard of that voyage
until long after, which perhaps is to be regretted,
since the war developed few more courageous
incidents than that twenty-five hundred mile run
of United States submarines, many of which were
but coastal boats and never meant for such a
venture.</p>

<p>But, although they had all come through safely
save one, each was in need of some repairs, inside
or out, and the next morning they gathered about
the mother ship like chickens about a clucking
hen and the overhauling began. Nelson bade
good-bye to Martin and to the rest of the <i>Q-4’s</i>
men and returned to the <i>Gyandotte</i>, which had
dropped her hooks nearly a mile below. Minus
one funnel, she had a most reprehensible appearance.
The officer of the deck shook his hand,
something quite foreign to precedent, and for the
subsequent hour Nelson was treated like a hero
by the men below. He had to tell his story more
than once and was glad when his shipmates began
at last to lose interest in his exploit. Getting
back to the freedom and spaciousness of the
cruiser was rather pleasant, after the confinement
of the <i>Q-4</i>, but he missed Martin Townsend and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
somehow regretted the uncomfortable, happy-go-lucky
existence he had left. Martin he was to
see again soon, for all ships were destined to remain
in port for a number of days, according to
report, and they had planned to get liberty together.</p>

<p>Some of the ships began coaling the next morning,
but, fortunately for Nelson, the <i>Gyandotte</i>
was not of the number and his watch was given
liberty. If you have never been through a week
of such stress and anxiety as those aboard the
<i>Gyandotte</i> you can’t well imagine the positive joy
of setting foot ashore once more. A quartermaster
voiced the sentiment of all in Nelson’s
boat when, as it drew toward the landing, he
remarked: “The best thing about going to sea
is getting back on land, fellows.” They all agreed
to that. And they groaned derisively when the
boatswain’s mate in charge added: “Yeah, and
the best thing about being ashore is getting back
to your ship.” It might be quite true, but it was
untimely!</p>

<p>Nelson found Martin awaiting him, according
to arrangement, at the little Y. M. C. A. hut
which had just been erected as a temporary headquarters
for the sailors, and they saw the town
pretty thoroughly during the next two hours. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
fact, they practically exhausted it long before
the two hours were over, for Queenstown, although
beautiful as to natural surroundings, holds
in itself little of interest. The harbor, however,
held plenty of action, for there were craft of all
sorts, sizes and nationalities there, even including a
German mine layer which had been brought in
early in the war and was lying, a sad-looking hulk,
on the flats near Haulbowline Island. At least,
the tattered lounger who pointed her out to them
said she was German, and as they wanted to think
so they didn’t seek corroboration. There was
even a Portuguese destroyer in sight, a strangely-shaped
craft that curved forward and aft until
bow and stern sat low in the water. She had been
streaked and spotted with grays and greens and
blues until she was at once strange and elusive to
the sight. Camouflaged hulls were fewer then
than later and the British destroyers, of which
there was one even then steaming slowly past
Spike Island, were still unrelievedly black. A
French chaser, however, had added pink to her
other tones and looked like a nautical hummingbird
or, possibly, a gay butterfly alighted on the
water. The boys climbed the hill back of the town
later and were well rewarded by the view that
spread before them. Fortunately the sun was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
shining and they could see far out onto the channel
southward and even locate Cork by the haze
of smoke that lay in the northwest. Toward
two o’clock they reached the town again and set
out in search of dinner. They found it at last,
but the least said of it the better. The only
point in its favor that Nelson could think of was
its price, and that was so ridiculous that he felt as
though he had cheated the proprietor of the little
water-front hotel.</p>

<p>They wrote letters that afternoon in the
Y. M. C. A. hut, disputing a table with so many
others that elbows knocked together. Nelson’s
brief epistle to his uncle was soon finished and then
he wrote a longer letter to his relations in Boston
and, finally, a shorter one to Billy Masters. After
that he looked through a two-months-old American
magazine and waited for Martin to finish “pouring
his heart out.” The expression is Nelson’s.
Perhaps he was a little bit envious. Having someone
to write to, someone who really cared to hear
from a chap, was pretty nice! Neither found
letters from home, a fact which disturbed Martin
more than it did his companion. Nelson pointed
out, however, that American mail hadn’t had time
to reach Queenstown yet, and Martin felt better.
They joined forces with nearly a dozen members<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
of the <i>Q-4’s</i> petty officers and crew and hired
numerous carriages—only they called them cars
there—and were driven around the island. It
was an hilarious and rather noisy trip, for they
were well through with a dangerous enterprise,
the sun was shining, the Irish fields were tender
green and they were young. Many a gossoon
who had never been familiar with a United States
coin before was richer by reason of that expedition.
As Clancy remarked—for Clancy was along
and led the singing: “There’s nothing in the
stores worth buying and we’ve got to spend it
somehow!”</p>

<p>Coming back they spied a baseball game going
on and, emitting wild shrieks of approval, abandoned
their equipages—paying the jarveys far
more than was reasonable—and joined the spectators.
Inquiry elicited the information that the
contending nines represented an American destroyer
and an American supply ship. Clancy
learned which team was leading in the score and
then, summoning his companions, began a vocal
bombardment of that team which so surprised and
distressed its pitcher that he added to the joy of
nations by passing the next two batsmen and
throwing an easy grounder over first baseman’s
head. The game had reached the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
seventh inning when the <i>Q-4’s</i> rioters appeared
and the score was 18 to 7 in favor of the destroyer’s
team, but Clancy rallied the neutrals, which
included many amused British Tommies from the
garrison, and conducted such a siege of cheering
and raillery that the supply ship came through in
the ninth with enough hits to win.</p>

<p>The destroyer team’s catcher, a big two-handed
Irish-American with flaming red hair and a belligerent
disposition, took Clancy to task the instant
he was free of his mask and protector and
there ensued as pretty a little informal scrap as
it had been the pleasure of the Britons to witness
for some time. They were awfully appreciative,
those Tommies, and did everything in
their power to make the affair a success, even to
joining hands and establishing a ring. A red-cheeked
sergeant took charge of proceedings and
appointed himself referee and everything went
off very nicely indeed. They found six rounds before
the destroyer “gob” took the count, during
which it was give-and-take all the way, with some
really scientific work by both men. Clancy looked
a bit the worse for wear at the end of the battle,
but he had the satisfaction of knowing that this opponent
looked a sight more disreputable. Subsequently
the late foes shook hands quite amicably,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
and principals, seconds and spectators returned to
the town in the finest of spirits, Briton and American
fraternizing in a fashion almost touching.</p>

<p>Despairing of finding a supper fit for persons
of their refinement and condition of hunger, Martin
and Nelson called it a day and returned to
their respective ships, agreeing to meet again at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>The opportunity didn’t occur until the second
day later, for the <i>Gyandotte</i> filled her bunkers
and Nelson’s presence was necessary on board.
The captain didn’t put it in those words, of course.
In fact, he didn’t say anything about it. The
order was “Coal ship,” and you knew what that
meant without being told, and knew that your
chance of getting ashore was just about as bright
as a lighted candle’s in a gale of wind. The <i>Gyandotte</i>
tried for a record that day, but failed by a
matter of six minutes, and there was subsequent
gloom that was dispelled only when soap and water
had removed the signs of toil and “chow” had refreshed
the inner man. The next day the task
of painting fell to the other hands and Nelson
again spread himself luxuriously on a thwart of
the first boat bearing the liberty party to shore.
Martin failed to show up until almost noon, however,
and Nelson passed rather a dull morning.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
He read all the newspapers and magazines he
could get his hands on at the hut and mailed three
picture postcards, and after that strolled along the
one main street of the town and wondered whether
any of the citizens of Queenstown ever did any
work. So far as he could see most of the inhabitants
were holding up the fronts of the buildings
along the water! He yielded to the blandishments
of four beggars, tried to understand the tearful
tale of a stranded Norwegian sailor, bought some
butterscotch and got his jaws stuck so firmly together
that he feared he would have to seek the
aid of a surgeon, and then literally walked into
the arms of Martin.</p>

<p>“Hello, Nep,” laughed the latter, releasing
him. “Lost your eyesight?”</p>

<p>“Nobagamatetutugada,” replied Nelson earnestly.</p>

<p>“Come again, please!”</p>

<p>“IhayIgamate——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand that,” said Martin gravely,
“but what happened after the torpedo struck?”</p>

<p>Nelson seized him by the arm, in desperation,
and started him up the hill.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” jabbered the other. “You’ve hidden
the corpse on top of the hill, eh? Better look
back and see if we’re followed, Nep. The last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
time I got mixed up in a crime of this sort I was
electrocuted.”</p>

<p>“Dobesiechum,” expostulated Nelson impatiently.
“Hapiesef.” He drew the bag of butterscotch
from his pocket and held it forth. Martin
viewed it suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m quite happy, thanks, but I don’t
think I want to eat any of that stuff. What is
it?”</p>

<p>“Buherhoct.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Has it any other name? Let’s look
at it. Oh, I get you, Nep. It’s butterscotch.
Why didn’t you say so?”</p>

<p>“Idi!”</p>

<p>“Not at all, old scout. You said something
that sounded like a giraffe blowing bubbles. No,
thanks, Nep. You may be stuck on that stuff,
but I’m not, and don’t intend to be. Is there any
hope for you? Or do you remain stuck-up and inarticulate
all day?”</p>

<p>“Iamin,” responded Nelson hopefully.</p>

<p>“Iamin, eh? Think of that? Why, I used
to know him. Nice chap, too. Say, where are
you taking me? <em>I</em> don’t want to go and see that
castle or monastery or whatever it is up there.
Let’s look for a movie show.”</p>

<p>Nelson freed his jaws by a final, despairing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
effort and after an agonized period of suspense
deposited a lump of butterscotch on someone’s
doorframe.</p>

<p>“Hang the stuff!” he exclaimed ruefully. “I’ve
nearly broken my jaws with it. Wonder what
sort of glue they put into it. Someone could make
his fortune if he could find out. Gee, but my
mouth aches!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with the rest of it?”
inquired Martin.</p>

<p>“Throw it away as far as——”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit! Don’t be wasteful, Nep. I know
something better. We’ll go back to Main Street
or Prairie Boulevard or whatever they call that
causeway down there and drop it along the pavement.
Then we’ll wait until it gets nice and
soft and make a lot of money prying folks loose.”</p>

<p>But Nelson didn’t think the scheme practical
and so they compromised by laying the bag on a
doorsill and hurrying off before they could be
caught and made to take it back.</p>

<p>The south of Ireland has a delightful climate
if you don’t mind being a bit damp. The sun
disappeared behind a fog bank about noon and
when they emerged from dinner—they had taken
advice and been rewarded by a well-cooked meal—it
was raining. At least, they called it rain, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
the inhabitants spoke of it as a mist. Whatever
it was, it made them wish they had their rubber
coats. They retired to the Y. M. C. A. hut to
wait for it to stop, but it showed no intention
of doing anything so obliging, and so, after awhile,
finding the hut deficient in excitement, they metaphorically
shrugged damp shoulders and swaggered
forth again. Perhaps it would have been
as well if they hadn’t, as things turned out. Or
perhaps, on the other hand, it was fortunate that
they did. It all depends on how you look at it.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERIOUS SIGNALS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">An hour later they found themselves getting
ashore on the farther side of the
harbor in a dense mist. By now they
had acquired a comfortable philosophy that took
no account of dampness. They had hired a small
boat that leaked cheerfully every minute and their
feet were as wet as their noses, and the latter
were dripping all the time. As one place was as
good as another to two boys seeking adventure
they had only attempted to keep from running
into the sinking one of the numerous ships that
dotted the channels. Just where they were, now
that they had landed and pulled the boat up, was
something they neither knew nor cared about.
They could see about fifty feet ahead of them,
which, as Martin pointed out, was quite sufficient
to keep them from traffic dangers. After leaving
the beach they crossed a field, pausing to read an
interesting “No trespassing” sign, and came to a
road. It wasn’t a bad road as south of Ireland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
roads go, but it looked uninteresting. So they
disregarded it and broke through a hedge on the
other side of it and walked into a bog.</p>

<p>Five minutes afterwards they were out again,
their feet <em>squishing</em> musically in their shoes. It
seemed to them intensely funny, and they laughed
hilariously over their plight and tried to see who
could make the more pleasing <em>squishes</em>. Martin
ventured the opinion that it was one of the justly
celebrated peat-bogs, which drew Nelson to murmur:
“For the love of peat!” Beyond the bog—they
had gone straight across it in spite of its
tenacity—was a field that climbed upward through
the fog, ending always fifty feet ahead. The danger
of walking off into a railway cut or into the
sea added excitement. That the sea was not far
distant was evident from the salt tang in the
air. They ultimately reached the summit of the
hill and made out the shape of a small building
which proved to be a tumbled-down cabin. There
was nothing inside save a litter of stone and rubbish
and the roof was gone except in one corner.
Weeds and grass grew from the crevices, and
Martin observed that it was without doubt extremely
picturesque, and that if he had his camera
with him he would snap it, but that as a place of
sanctuary it was a fizzle. Nelson pointed out the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
remains of a fireplace and chimney, but there
was nothing in sight that looked like fuel, and, as
Martin said, they hadn’t brought away enough
of the peat-bog to make much of a fire. So they
went on again, unhurriedly, happily, hands in
pockets and shoulders humped to keep the fog
from trickling down their necks. After ten or
fifteen minutes, during which they were twice
turned back by a hedge and a ditch, it dawned on
them that they were quite as thoroughly lost as
any collar button that ever rolled under a bureau!</p>

<p>Whereupon they clutched each other tightly
and laughed long and loud!</p>

<p>Martin presently looked at his watch and, having
recovered a degree of sobriety, announced the
hour as half-past four. That struck Nelson as
being very, very comical, and he began to laugh
all over again. Martin called him a silly ass and
said it was a good thing it wasn’t twelve o’clock,
since in that case Nelson would probably have
hysterics.</p>

<p>I might give a detailed account of what transpired
during the next four hours, but you would
find it tiresome, although not so tiresome as they
did! Briefly, though, let me tell you that they
tried to find, first of all, the tumble-down hut,
in which they failed utterly, and that they subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
put the coast behind them, according to
their calculations, and set out for the harbor, in
the hope that they would either find the boat they
had rowed across in or, failing that, some other
means of transportation. They got thoroughly
wet and a trifle shivery, as night drew near, but
they didn’t find the shore of the harbor. They
simply couldn’t find anything! They were fairly
certain that not far away in more than one direction
lay villages, or, at least, dwellings, but Fate
guided their footsteps so carefully that not the
slightest sign of a habitation rewarded them. As
Martin grumbled—for they reached the grumbling
stage eventually—if they had committed
murder and were trying to keep away from folks
they’d probably bump into a house every fifty
yards!</p>

<p>When darkness came, earlier because of the
mist which grew heavier as time went on, they did
at last reach a shore, but it wasn’t the harbor that
lay before them. There were rocks and no sign
of a beach save at infrequent intervals where the
ledges broke apart, and the big waves that roared
against those stone battlements were straight from
the Atlantic. So, of course, what they had done
was to cross the headland, a matter of a full five
miles, keeping in a direction quite contrary to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
one sought, which, in fog or darkness, is exactly
what one is most likely to do. They knew that to
their right was the entrance to the harbor, with
a lighthouse on a point, but how far away it might
be there was no telling. What lay along the
shore in the other direction they didn’t know.
Consequently they turned westward, toward the
light. The night was not cold, but here on the
cliffs a chill breath from the ocean penetrated
their saturated clothing, sent shivers up and down
their backs and set their teeth chattering. Perhaps
if they had been able to walk briskly they
could have kept warm, but when one doesn’t know
whether the next step is to drop him over the
edge of a cliff, walking briskly is not advisable.
They went on, making what progress they might,
trying to keep the feel of the turf underfoot, but
frequently finding themselves stumbling over the
bare surface of the ledges. They were doing but
little talking now and had quite forgotten for the
time how to laugh. They were miserably hungry,
and when Nelson spoke feelingly out of the darkness
of a cup of hot coffee Martin threatened to
throw him over the cliff if he didn’t stop. There
is no saying how fast they traveled, but I think
that if they covered a quarter of a mile of that
going in a half-hour they did well. It was close<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
on nine when Martin looked at the faintly illuminated
dial of his wrist watch for the last time.
They were then in the lee of a rock which for
the moment disputed their path, and they had
paused to regain their breaths before finding their
way around it. And it was at that moment of
panting silence that they saw the light.</p>

<p>It flashed forth suddenly below them as though
in the water: once—twice—three times, and disappeared.
So surprised were they that it was not
until its faint rays had gone that Martin opened
his mouth to hail. That only a sort of gasp issued
was due to the fact that his companion laid a
warning clutch on his arm.</p>

<p>“Wait!” whispered Nelson. “Don’t shout!”</p>

<p>“Why not? It’s a boat, you chump!” But
Martin dropped his voice to match Nelson’s.</p>

<p>“I know, but what’s it doing? Let’s wait a
minute, Mart, and find out. The light wasn’t
directed toward us, but out to sea, and—Look!”</p>

<p>Very faintly an answering beacon glimmered
through the mist: once and again.</p>

<p>“Well, that doesn’t prove anything, does it?”
asked Martin impatiently. “What’s the big idea?
Maybe you think it’s the German Navy come to
take Ireland?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it is,” responded Nelson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
cautiously, “but when you see lights flashing along
the shore these days it’s a good plan to keep your
eyes peeled.”</p>

<p>“Probably a Coast Guard or a—a—look here,
we don’t want to spend the night on this forsaken
place, Nep. That fellow, whoever he is, has a
boat, and even if he won’t take us off he can probably
tell us how to find a village.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think the light down there was in a
boat,” said Nelson. “I think there’s a bit of
beach there. A boat where that light was would
be right in the surf. Listen, Mart. We’re farther
from the water than we were.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but——” Martin began querulously, but
stopped. After a moment he went on in a different
tone. “Maybe you’re right, Nep,” he said
softly. “Come on and let’s see where we are,
first of all.”</p>

<p>They crept gingerly in the direction of the first
light, testing each step for fear that they might
reach the edge of the cliff too suddenly. Low
bushes took the place of the sod, and small stones
impeded their uncertain steps. After a minute
they stopped abruptly, for, below them and nearer
now, the first light they had glimpsed was again
flashing its message into the mist and gloom.
Three times it showed and then went out. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
boys waited. Moments passed and no answering
beacon appeared at sea. Then, when they had
almost reached the conclusion that they had imagined
that first reply, two dim flashes lit the darkness.</p>

<p>“It’s much nearer,” whispered Mart.</p>

<p>“Yes, and that light down here is from a lantern
on the beach. It looks queer to me, Mart.”</p>

<p>“Sure it’s queer! It’s some funny business that
we’ve got to find out about, old man. Flop down
on your tummy and crawl out to the edge, but
be careful and don’t make a row. Come on.”</p>

<p>The edge was much farther than they had
thought, and long before they had reached it they
were wriggling down a slope of worn ledge, fissured
and broken, that was extremely detrimental
to clothing. Mart found the edge first when his
exploring hand failed to touch anything ahead of
him and he gave a warning whisper. Lying on
their stomachs with their heads close together
they exchanged impressions.</p>

<p>“The beach can’t be more than twenty feet
down,” whispered Nelson. “I think I heard the
chap with the lantern a second ago.”</p>

<p>“Someone’s trying to make a landing,” said
Martin, “and that light is to guide him. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
gets me is how they’d dare show a light if everything
wasn’t—well, all right.”</p>

<p>“Why? Who’s to see it a night like this?
None of the patrol boats would be near enough
to catch even a glimpse of it. Light doesn’t
travel far in a mist of this sort.”</p>

<p>“Right-o! I suppose they chose tonight on
purpose, eh? What’ll we do now?”</p>

<p>“I guess we can’t do anything but wait and
watch. If we could—Listen! Oars!”</p>

<p>Oars, indeed, and quite distinct in a muffled
way, oars rattling and creaking against row-locks
or thole-pins and becoming louder each instant.
A faint sound came from almost below them, as
though the watcher on the beach had kicked a
stone in moving. Then the lantern appeared once
more and swung back and forth several times,
moving slowly away from the cliff as the bearer
approached the edge of the surf.</p>

<p>“Gee, this is exciting!” murmured Martin.
“Say, it would help a bit if we had our automatics
with us, wouldn’t it? We might capture a German
landing-party!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they’re Germans,” said Nelson
thoughtfully, his voice no more than a whisper.
“Not even a German sub would dare come so
close.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“It might be ‘Kelly,’” suggested Martin.</p>

<p>“Who’s ‘Kelly’?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you heard about him? He’s a German
submarine commander who does all sorts of
stunts, if you believe what you hear, like landing
on the coast hereabouts once and going into Cork
and living there a couple of days. And he leaves
messages tacked on the Channel buoys, they say.
Of course it’s probably all yarns. That boat’s
pretty close to the surf, Nep.”</p>

<p>They listened in silence a moment. Then Nelson
said: “I think they’re probably Irish rebels;
Sinn Feiners, don’t they call them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all over with, I guess. Besides,
what would they be doing in a boat off-shore?”</p>

<p>“Landing rifles or ammunition, or both,” responded
the other. “I don’t believe that trouble
is all over, either, Mart. They threw stones at
our sailors in Cork only a few weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“At our men? What for?” asked Martin in
an indignant whisper.</p>

<p>“Because we’re fighting the Germans, and the
Sinn Feiners are pro-German, or pro-anything
that’ll make trouble for England. There they
come!”</p>

<p>From below came the sound of a boat’s keel
grating on the sand, and the unmistakable tramp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
of feet within it, followed by a splashing noise
as someone leaped out and guided the bow out
of water. After that the silence was over. Low
voices murmured. Feet scuffled softly on sand or
shingle. Although they could see nothing, their
imaginations pictured the busy scene below: men,
perhaps a half-dozen all told, bearing burdens
from boat to shore, splashing through the ripples,
grinding over the shingle, disappearing somewhere
beneath, perhaps into a cave. The old tales of
smuggling in the British Isles returned to memory
and they had visions of a great, high cavern running
back from the edge of the beach, a cavern
piled with mysterious boxes and bales. But the
cavern theory was quickly dissipated, for of a sudden
footsteps sounded near at hand and they heard
the labored breathing of men as they made their
way up some unseen pass from below, and, once, a
muttered exclamation and the trickling fall of a
dislodged stone. It seemed to the boys that the
men must be almost upon them, and they prepared
themselves for flight, but the footsteps crunched
past a dozen feet away and became soundless as
they reached the rough turf of the summit. Then
others followed. Whatever the burdens were
that they bore up the cliff they must have been
fairly heavy, for breathing was labored and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
scuffling sound of the booted feet suggested that
they labored under considerable weight.</p>

<p>For a number of minutes Nelson and Martin
lay and listened, and in that time, they gathered,
three loads were brought up, and the first bearers
began their descent again. Now and then a low
word was spoken, but the hearers failed to gather
the sense of it. Martin tugged at Nelson’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“Listen for the last of them to go back,” he
whispered. “Then follow me and we’ll see where
they’re taking the stuff. Better keep in touch
so we won’t get lost. Ready now?”</p>

<p>They crept back from the edge and then, arising
to their feet, left the cliff behind and made
their way as quietly as possible into the darkness.
When they had gone some thirty yards or
so Martin drew Nelson down beside him. “We’ll
wait here until they come back,” he said. “Maybe
we can hear where they go.”</p>

<p>“Hope we aren’t in their way,” whispered Nelson.
“Hate to have them walk on me.”</p>

<p>“If they do, don’t move. Just make a noise
like a shamrock!” Martin chuckled softly. “Say,
Nep, I haven’t had so much fun since I ran a nail
in my foot! Where do you suppose they’re caching
the stuff?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>“Can’t imagine unless—Ssh! They’re coming
up again!”</p>

<p>Whether the mist grew momentarily thinner
or whether his sight had grown more accustomed
to the darkness Nelson didn’t know, but a second
later he caught a dim vision of two shapes appearing
above the cliff’s edge. The vision was
instantly lost, however, and they had only the
sounds to guide them. The men seemed to be bearing
to their left, and after an instant Martin
tugged at Nelson and they skirmished in that direction.
Once Nelson tripped over something and
sprawled on his hands and knees, and Martin fell
to the ground beside him and they kept very still
for a minute. But if Nelson had made any noise
it had gone unnoted by the men, for the boys
could still hear them ahead there. Once there
came the unmistakable sound of a heavy object
dropping with a jarring thud onto a wooden surface.</p>

<p>“Boxes,” whispered Nelson. “They’re piling
them up over there.”</p>

<p>“We might fill our pockets with them and beat
it,” suggested Martin. “Think they’ve gone back
yet?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Listen. Hear anything?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>“No. Come on and let’s get to the bottom of
this.”</p>

<p>Once more they crept forward. The ground
was rough now, interspersed with tiny bushes, and
they had to feel their way cautiously to avoid
noise. Suddenly Martin, slightly in the lead, stumbled
down a little bank, repressing an exclamation
of surprise, and felt wheel ruts underfoot.
With a low warning to his companion he peered
intently into the enshrouding gloom. Was it
imagination or did the darkness loom more black?
Cautiously, with outstretched hands, he moved
forward. Then his fingers brushed a chill, damp
surface and a dim shape took form before him.</p>

<p>“Back up!” he cautioned. “We’ve got it!
It’s—great Scott, it’s a wagon! You listen for
them, Nep, and I’ll feel around a bit. Hear anything?
We’ll have to drop if they come. Whoa,
boy!” Nelson heard his friend whispering as
he drew away. There was a jingle of harness,
such a sound as a horse might cause by tossing
his head. Meanwhile Nelson’s hands were passing
enquiringly over the vehicle. He made out
a big, wide-tired wheel, the body, a cloth top
stretching upward from it, and then, moving a
pace, the lowered tailboard and the face of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
box lying at one side of the wagon bed. At that
moment Martin stepped back to his side.</p>

<p>“It’s a covered wagon,” he whispered, “with
two horses. They’ve got them anchored with a
cobblestone as big as your head. I cut the cable,
though.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>Martin chuckled, but his explanation had to
wait, for the men were coming back again and
there was just time for the two boys to reach
the farther side of the wagon and drop to the
earth before the leaders lurched to the back.</p>

<p>“One, two—heave!” said a voice, and there
was a jar as another box landed. Then someone
scrambled inside and the box was pushed into
place. Other steps shuffled up and the performance
was repeated. Then:</p>

<p>“How many more are there, Petey?” asked a
voice.</p>

<p>“Two more. By the Saints, boys, it’s broke
entirely me back is.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loud, you! Sure, there’s other
backs here. Stand aside there. Aisy now, boys!
No noise!”</p>

<p>A third burden was deposited and shoved into
place. “Is that the last?” one of the men asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>“It is not. I’m wishin’ it was. There’s two
more down below.”</p>

<p>“Let Mike carry them, then. I’m through.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? You’ll take your end, just the
same, my lad.” The speaker sounded authoritative.
“Come on now and get it through.”</p>

<p>They turned back along the path and low voices
and footsteps dwindled to silence. For a minute
only the occasional drip of the moisture from
the wagon broke the stillness. Then one of the
horses pawed impatiently at the ground and Martin
sprang to action.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he whispered. “Here’s where we
take a drive!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Nelson
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Put your foot on the hub and climb in. Whoa,
boys! Easy now! Are you in?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but——”</p>

<p>“We’re off! Get ap, Jehosophat!” The
wagon creaked, Nelson collided with something
extremely hard behind him and they went lurching
off through the darkness.</p>

<small>THROUGH THE NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“But, look here, Mart! How the dickens
will you know where to go? I don’t
believe this is a real road we’re on!”</p>

<p>“Give ’em their heads, old scout: that’s the
only way. Every nag knows how to get home.
All we’ve got to do is hold on and——” Just
then a wheel struck a rock and nearly threw them
out. “And still hold on,” ended Martin, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“They’ll be after us in a shake,” said Nelson
pessimistically.</p>

<p>“A fat chance of finding us they’ll have! Just
as soon as we get on asphalt I’ll touch ’em up.
Feel a whip anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Asphalt! Where do you think you are? Fifth
Avenue, New York?”</p>

<p>“Feels like it now and then,” chuckled Mart.
“Get ap, Bones! Say, wouldn’t it be funny if
it was dynamite we had in there behind?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>Nelson jumped. “Gee! Do you suppose it
is?”</p>

<p>“Might be,” was the cheerful reply. “How
about that whip?”</p>

<p>“I don’t find one.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. It probably wouldn’t do any
good, anyway.” For a minute or more they
thumped and swayed over the road, if road it was,
without further speech. Nelson tried to listen
for sounds of pursuit, but the creaking of the
wheels and the straining of the wagon prevented.
Then Martin laughed softly beside him. “Say,
won’t they be surprised when they get back and
don’t find it?” he asked. “Can’t you just picture
them stumbling around in the dark? They’ll think
at first that they’ve missed the place. Then they’ll
conclude that the horses have moved off a bit.
Oh, they’ll have a jolly time of it!”</p>

<p>“They’ll follow us, of course,” said Nelson.
“Don’t you suppose they can hear this old thing
rumbling and squeaking a mile away?”</p>

<p>“That’s so! I hadn’t thought of that! Well,
we’ll give them a run for their money, anyhow.
Get ap, Roger! Get ap, Queen Bess! Say, what
do they call horses in Ireland?”</p>

<p>“Pat and Mike, I guess.” Nelson put an uneasy
head around the side of the wagon, but, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
that a sudden lurch brought his ear in violent
contact with a piece of wood, nothing resulted.
At that moment the horses turned to the right, the
front wheels jarred down a little declivity and
the wagon began to move faster.</p>

<p>“Ata boy!” approved Martin. “Some speed
to these nags, what? Blessed if they aren’t actually
trotting! Or were,” he added with less enthusiasm
as the horses dropped to a walk again.
“Get ap, consarn ye! Wish to goodness I had a
whip! Or a stick of dynamite!”</p>

<p>“Open one of the cases in there,” suggested
Nelson dryly.</p>

<p>“It would be an awful joke on us if those same
cases held canned tomatoes or some silly thing
like that! Think of opening them and finding a
lot of ‘Sinn Fein Brand Early June Peas’!”</p>

<p>“They’re rifles, I think,” said Nelson. “The
cases felt sort of long and narrow. As I make it
out, those folks in the boat came from some
schooner anchored out beyond there. The man
with the lantern was the fellow who brought this
wagon. Maybe there were two of him. What
I can’t see is what he expected to do with the stuff.
He wouldn’t dare take it into the town.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t unless he swam it across the harbor.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. Or unless he drove all the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
around to Midleton and went in by the road over
the bridges. There’s a way to the mainland there,
you know.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t know it. I thought Queenstown
was on an island.”</p>

<p>“So it is, but I said bridges, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t get huffy about it. I suppose this
stuff was going to someone’s house or barn or haymow
tonight. Then, later, they’d take it up to
Cork or Dublin or somewhere. Well, their plans
are all shot to pieces, Nep.”</p>

<p>“Unless they catch us in the next half-hour,”
replied Nelson gloomily. “Won’t those nags go
any faster?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask them. Can you accelerate your pace
any, horsies? Get ap, you Sinn Feiners!”</p>

<p>Strangely enough that epithet had an effect and
the horses broke into a lumbering trot. The road
was fairly good now and Martin was careful to
offer no suggestions to the nags. They kept the
trot up for a quarter of a mile or so before relapsing
again into their leisurely walk. By that
time Nelson was breathing easier and it seemed
to him that they might, after all, elude pursuit.</p>

<p>“How far is it around to Queenstown by this
road you tell of?” asked Martin presently. Nelson
tried to conjure up the map in the guide book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
he had bought the first day ashore but with poor
success. He had to own at last that he hadn’t any
idea.</p>

<p>“Well, ten miles? Twenty? Fifty?”</p>

<p>“I suppose about twenty,” he said doubtfully.
Martin whistled softly and expressively, and
peered at his watch.</p>

<p>“It’s a little after nine-thirty,” he mused. “At
the rate we’re going we ought to get there about
five in the morning—if the horses don’t die first!”</p>

<p>“Why go into Queenstown, then?” asked Nelson.
“We’re bound to find a village pretty soon.
Anyhow, there’s Midleton.”</p>

<p>“How far’s that?”</p>

<p>“About halfway, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well——” Martin was silent a minute.
Then: “I tell you what we’ll do, Nep. We’re in
wrong anyhow for out-staying liberty, and we
might as well be hung for sheep as for lambs.
We’ll find this Midleton place you tell about and
be sure we’re headed right. Then we’ll stop and
have a few hours’ sleep and drive into Queenstown
in the morning in triumph. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>“Sounds crazy to me,” objected Nelson. “All
except the sleep part of it. That sounds mighty
reasonable. But of course what’ll happen is that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
we’ll be arrested for carrying rifles around the
country without a license, or whatever you have
to have. I want some sleep, but I don’t care to
take it in jail!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to risk that,” said Martin. “Besides,
we’re American sailors and if they arrest
us we’ll threaten to tell Mr. Wilson. Say, am I
dippy, or is that a light ahead there?”</p>

<p>“Both, I guess. Anyway, it’s a light.” Nelson
was beginning to regain his cheerfulness. “But
we’d better not stop anywhere just yet, Mart.
Those fellows might persuade folks that we’d
stolen their team.”</p>

<p>“The very idea! Do we look like fellows who
would steal?”</p>

<p>“I can’t see what we look like, but I have a
strong suspicion that we do. Also murder. I
know my trousers are torn on both knees, and
they’re my best ones, too, by the way, and I’m
pretty certain that I’m wet and dirty and generally
hoboish. I’d rather not have any traffic with a
cop, Mart.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right. Appearances are sometimes
deceitful. Anyhow, I guess that’s only a
house, that light. Probably a farm. We aren’t
going very near it.”</p>

<p>The light, a dim glimmer through some trees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
was passed on the left and the wagon trundled on,
Martin at intervals prevailing on his mettlesome
steeds to attempt a gait slightly faster than a
walk. The mist wasn’t quite so thick inland here,
but it continued to be extremely wet and they were
both shivering. It was Nelson who proposed getting
down and walking for awhile to get warm.</p>

<p>“Good idea,” said Martin with approval.
“Maybe lightening the load will encourage Shamrock
and St. Peter there. It would be awful if
they ran away, though.”</p>

<p>“I’d be quite as well satisfied,” sighed Nelson.
“The whole thing is a silly business, anyway. I
wish we’d minded our own affairs!”</p>

<p>“Who was it proposed spying on those poor,
inoffensive Sinn Feiners first?” demanded Martin
indignantly. “I’d have shouted to them and——”</p>

<p>“Got cracked on the head. Sure! I saved
you from that, anyway, but it wasn’t my idea to
spend the night creaking around Ireland in a
prairie schooner.”</p>

<p>“Guess it looks more like a butcher’s cart, Nep.
I say, if we only could get something to eat! Why
not? There must be food somewhere in this
lovely but benighted land. When we strike a
village I’ll forage. Gee, I feel better already!”</p>

<p>The village didn’t materialize, though, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
more than an hour, by which time they were back
on the seat again and Nelson was frankly asleep.
It was a tiny hamlet, at that, and few lights
showed. They drove creaking through it, barked
at by two dogs, and halted on the further side.
Then Martin got stiffly down and went back while
Nelson held the lines and tried to keep himself
awake. Martin returned empty-handed after ten
minutes or so.</p>

<p>“A beautifully hospitable place,” he said bitterly.
“I tried five houses and at each one they
threatened to have me arrested if I didn’t go
away. I didn’t get a bite, but one of those dogs
did—very nearly.” He rubbed an ankle as he
climbed back into his place. “Get ap, you handsome
brutes! Here, you take the lines awhile,
Nep, and let me have a nap. Wake me if we
come to an all-night lunch!”</p>

<p>Martin yielded the reins and leaned against his
side of the wagon and was soon snoring. Nelson,
blinking to keep his eyes open, slouched sleepily
in his seat with loose lines. Once he was startled
by the sound of a vehicle coming from ahead in
the gloom, the first they had met, and pulled the
reins hurriedly to make room for it to pass. Perhaps
the lines were crossed and he steered the
horses toward the center of the road. At all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
events, there was a sound of colliding hubs followed
by a fine collection of oaths delivered in a
rich Irish brogue. Nelson was much too sleepy to
offer apology or explanation and the unknown but
eloquent traveler rattled on into the night, complimentary
to the last.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight they rumbled across a
bridge and onto the cobbles of a fair-sized village.
By now it was possible to see the horses’
heads and a corresponding distance on all sides
and Nelson awoke Martin from his slumber. The
town seemed utterly dark and deserted until,
presently, the street on which they traveled turned
abruptly and a lantern above a doorway confronted
them with the startling legend: “Police.”
Beyond it a few lights showed dimly in another
building and from somewhere in the darkness further
away a train was being shunted along a track.
Martin viewed the police station doubtfully and
went past. The next collection of lights came
from the lower floor of a small hotel. It didn’t
look very hospitable, but nevertheless Martin
stopped the horses—he experienced no difficulty—climbed
down and disappeared from sight.
Nelson heard a door open and close. He lolled
on the seat and nodded in the faint radiance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
the lighted windows. After an interminable time
Martin returned.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” he said gruffly, climbing back.
“The old geezer wanted to fight me for waking
him up. Nothing to eat until the kitchen opens
at five-thirty in the morning. Didn’t even invite
me to wait.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” groaned Nelson. “I’ve lost interest
in food. But couldn’t we get beds in
there?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I wouldn’t patronize his old den,
anyway. We’ll find a place along the road and
turn in and go to sleep with the dynamite. Get
ap, horses!”</p>

<p>The horses awoke, sighed loudly and settled
against the harness again and the wagon rumbled
on through the silent, darkened streets.</p>

<small>BOYS IN KHAKI</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Just as the sun broke forth from the bank
of mist that trailed its gray banners along
the hillsides to the east a squeaking wagon,
drawn by a pair of thin, decrepit looking white
horses and occupied by two youths in what remained
of the blue uniforms of United States sailors,
drew up in front of police headquarters in
Queenstown. It was too early for many of the
citizens to be abroad, although here and there a
sleepy pedestrian cast a vacantly curious stare at
the odd apparition. From the seat one of the occupants
yielded the frayed lines and got down stiffly,
disappearing into the station. Those few early
persons who paused to witness subsequent events
were forced to wait for a good ten minutes. Then
the youth in sailor togs, whose left sleeve bore
an eagle above crossed cannons, done in white,
and a single scarlet chevron below, emerged once
more in company with two stalwart “Bobbies.”
A hasty glance into the back of the wagon, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
the jaded horses were again started and the whole
outfit disappeared behind the gates and was lost
to view of the curious observers.</p>

<p>Five minutes later a police sergeant was very
gingerly introducing a chisel under the lid of the
nearest box on the wagon. The sergeant looked
a bit unhappy, for Martin had innocently advanced
the possibility of the cases containing explosives.
At each <em>creak</em> of the lid as it gave to
the chisel the sergeant flinched perceptibly, while
his companion edged the fraction of an inch further
into the background. Even Nelson was none
too certain that a nice collection of dynamite
bombs or guncotton cylinders was not about to
reward their investigation. But in a moment a
sigh of relief went up from the sergeant as the
lid gave at last and revealed the contents.</p>

<p>“Guns!” he said devoutly.</p>

<p>And guns they were, rifles, neatly nested between
much excelsior, with wicked looking sights
of a sort quite new to either of the boys if not to
the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Ha! German! Cast your eye on ’em,
Flaherty! What do you say to that now? The
murderin’ rapscallions! ’Twas to Dublin they
was meanin’ to take ’em, mark my words,
Flaherty! It’s the Sinn Feiners as landed ’em and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
that divil of a Rosmoyne crowd that was handlin’
’em. If them horses didn’t have their last feed
forninst the Two Rocks I’ll eat me hat. Unhitch
’em, Flaherty, an’ put ’em in the stable till
the Captain comes on an’ tells us what’ll we do
with ’em. You gentlemen will wait an’ give your
evidence, please. Step inside, sirs.”</p>

<p>“That’s all well enough,” objected Nelson, “but
we’re hungry. We haven’t had anything to eat
since yesterday noon. We’ll get our breakfasts
and be back in half an hour.”</p>

<p>But the sergeant was adamant. They must
await the appearance of the captain who was due
in another twenty minutes. So, with sighs, they
preceded their captor up the steps and into the
bare office inside where, for the subsequent twenty
or twenty-five minutes, they stifled the demands of
two healthy hungers and impatiently awaited the
advent of the police captain. The sergeant and
the other officer, who appeared to be an ordinary
constable, although he exuded so much dignity
that the boys were in doubt as to that, were inclined
to be chatty but found little encouragement
from their guests.</p>

<p>In the course of time, following the arrival
of several constables who dribbled in at intervals
and had to hear the story of the capture from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
sergeant, the captain himself at last materialized.
He proved to be a slight, wistful looking man
with a Cockney accent and a manner at once apologetic
and suspicious. The boys’ troubles began
the moment the sergeant had finished his story.
The captain bent a mild blue eye on them and
announced sadly: “Wotever you sy will be used
agynst you, my men.” At least, that is what Martin
always stoutly averred that he said. Nelson
thinks he phrased it slightly differently.</p>

<p>However, nothing was used against them, so
it didn’t matter. The captain asked them so
many questions that they were almost dizzy—although
lack of food may have had something to
do with it—and wrote every answer down slowly,
sadly, laboriously. They had to delve into the
ancient history to satisfy that official and reveal
their ancestors as far back as the third generation,
and tell their religious beliefs, political predilections
and ethical standards. At last they were
allowed to stagger forth, although they were severely
informed that it would be their duty to hold
themselves in readiness at all times to answer further
questions.</p>

<p>If ever food tasted better than it did that
morning neither of the boys was able to remember
the occasion. They ate until it was necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
to slump down and sit on their spines, until even
the cheerful and untidy waitress viewed them apprehensively.
After a long, dreamy half hour
over the empty coffee cups they arose, paid their
scores and made for the landing and the ships
to face the music.</p>

<p>Reaching the <i>Gyandotte</i>, Nelson reported to
the officer of the deck and hurried below to change
his togs before he was sent for to face the first
lieutenant. That proved less of an ordeal than
he feared, for his straightforward story, strange
as it was, carried conviction and even brought
more than one fleeting smile to the officer’s face.
“I’ll look into the story, Troy,” was the decision,
“and if I find it’s just as you’ve told it you’ll hear
no more. Hereafter, however, see that you keep
close enough to the ship so that weather conditions
won’t get you into trouble. Frustrating
Feinians is all very well in a way, Troy, but you
aren’t here for that.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Chief Constable, although
that might not have been his real title, came
aboard in company with two minor officials and
Nelson had to go through his story again. This
time he was made to feel somewhat less like a
criminal. In fact, the Chief intimated that he and
Martin had displayed wit and courage, and seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
inclined to be a trifle grateful; which, considering
that they had captured more than a hundred rifles,
Nelson secretly thought appropriate. There were
most sensational if extremely vague stories in the
newspapers in which Martin’s name was “Townser”
and Nelson’s “Tory.” That ended the incident,
so far as they were concerned. What ultimately
became of the white horses, which had so
faithfully performed their duty that night, and
the creaking wagon, they never learned. They
met only once more during the stay at Queenstown,
and on that occasion their liberties barely
overlapped, and they were together but an hour
or so. The next day the submarine flotilla slid
quietly out of the harbor, with the old mother ship
wobbling along behind, and were soon out of sight
around Roche’s Point. On the <i>Gyandotte</i> it was
rumored that they were to go up to the north
coast of Scotland and join the British submarines
on guard there, but no one knew for certain.
There were a great many things concerning the
movements of ships that one didn’t know in those
days.</p>

<p>Nelson missed Martin horribly at first, and was
a bit mopey as long as the old <i>Gyandotte</i> stayed
at the base. Fortunately for his spirits, that wasn’t
long. She followed the submarines through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
booms just two days later, picking her way between
anchored mines as daintily as any fine
lady avoiding mud puddles, and, wigwagging a
last signal to the forts, headed south. Nelson
saw the hills of Queenstown fade into the brown
and purple shadows of evening and finally disappear.
Later the cruiser altered her course
and in the first full darkness the light of Fastnet
flashed at them from starboard. Nelson
slept finely that night, for the <i>Gyandotte</i> rolled
comfortably and creaked and rubbed her seams
and was quite home-like again.</p>

<p>In the morning they were out of sight of land,
lounging over a calm gray-blue sea in company
with three destroyers. At daylight the four ships
scuttled into line and held a deal of conversation
by means of gay signal flags. The lookouts had
hourly spasms, for that summer the waters around
Great Britain and France for three hundred miles
away from the coasts were thick with floating
débris, and, with sufficient imagination on the
part of the lookout, an empty lard pail makes an
excellent periscope a mile away, while an abandoned
mattress at two miles is as fine a conning
tower for practice purposes as soul could desire.
Those destroyers were new at the game and filled
with enthusiasm, and half a dozen times that day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
the sharp bark of three-inch or four-inch guns added
to the joy of life. When it wasn’t inanimate
wreckage that made a lookout gasp and shout incoherently
it was a porpoise. A porpoise appearing
suddenly near the bow suggests just one thing
in the world, and it isn’t “Porpoise!” It’s “Torpedo!”
The <i>Gyandotte</i> was theoretically blown
to bits at least five times that day by playful porpoises!
What distressed the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> secondary
battery crews was that while the destroyers
were forever letting fly at something, or, at
least, preparing to, the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> place at number
three in the formation presupposed her to be
safely guarded and gave no excuse for potting
mythical periscopes.</p>

<p>That was a wonderful day, though. Aside
from imitation U-boats, there was other excitement.
Once they sighted and bore down on a
big four-masted schooner from which trailed a
long veil of black smoke. One of the destroyers
slipped out of column and had speech with the
schooner and later reported to the cruiser:
“American ship <i>Annie B. Wells</i>, Baltimore, in
cargo. Struck a mine yesterday evening and
started a fire in some turpentine casks. Says she
has fire under control and will be able to make
Havre without assistance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>Later two mine sweepers wallowed along under
convoy of a diminutive chaser painted with
more colors than she had tonnage. Again it
was a big Italian freighter, high-sided, rusty-red
in spots and squares, ambling along for Bordeaux.
But by night the highway was empty and the four
ships slid westward into a gentle sea while a soft
breeze blew from the south and whispered of
Spanish orange groves. Nelson was always glad
he experienced the North Atlantic under the conditions
he found that day and night, for never
again, for as long as he roamed it, was it so kindly
and bland.</p>

<p>In the morning, five hundred miles west of
Land’s End, they awoke to green seas that buffeted
the bow under the steady push of a southeast wind
and to a sky that alternated sun and squall. The
destroyers rolled merrily and the spindrift flew
aft as far as their second stacks. There was more
signaling about noon and at two o’clock smoke
was sighted ahead and the four ships picked up
their pace and plowed on into an anxious group
of transports and convoys. The transports were
big passenger liners and their decks were solid
brown streaks where boys in khaki waved and
cheered, three and four deep behind the rails,
as the newcomers sped amongst them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>That was a fine sight to Nelson. Leaning from
the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> Number Four gun port, he waved
back, and cheered a little, too, but was rather
too chokey to make much noise. Lewis, first shellman,
who leaned at Nelson’s elbow, didn’t try to
shout. He just grinned all the time, and blinked
his eyes, and kept muttering, over and over:
“They’re the boys to do it! Good old kids from
the U. S. A.!” Nelson wondered at the tier on
tier of faces, blurred by distance, that looked
down from the many decks of the big liners. He
couldn’t see the expression of any individual countenance,
for the <i>Gyandotte</i> didn’t get close enough
for that, but it seemed to him that a sort of composite
and kindly grin beamed over the water
from every one of the troopships. Now and then,
when the wind allowed, he could hear the cheering,
steady, continuous, and always broad-brimmed
campaign hats fluttered like brown leaves
in a breeze.</p>

<p>“They’re the boys! Good old kids from the
U. S. A.!” He found himself repeating Lewis’
slogan in time to the song of the ship’s engines.
He felt very warm about his heart and a trifle
damp of eye, and was proud and haughty and
wouldn’t have given a plugged nickel for the
whole German Empire just then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Gyandotte</i>, flags fluttering, siren shrieking
once or twice, sped along the edge of the
crowd and wheeled into position far back on
the starboard, almost touching elbows with a still
smaller cruiser, whose graceful, yacht-like lines
brought memories of Guantanamo. Twelve transports
and six convoys had been the story until
the new escort arrived. Now there were but four
of the original convoys left, for two were already
showing their propellers and hiking back to the
west: “Straight for Broadway,” as one yearning
voice on the <i>Gyandotte</i> phrased it. Altogether
the convoy now consisted of three cruisers—one
an armored craft—and five destroyers. The “Big
Lady” was saturnine looking and forbidding, like
a great gray bulldog, and had four ridiculously
high funnels and a basket mast forward and a
military mast aft and was all broken out with
search lights like a child with measles. She was
the flagship, and didn’t she know it? She signaled
orders so fast that the signalmen dripped
perspiration in the teeth of a southeast wind, and
she gave the impression of being short-tempered
and dangerous to fool with, and the result was
that in an incredibly short time everyone was in
the right place and on the very best possible behavior
and the twelve adventurers were plowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
on again at standard speed, every nose set straight
for the port of Bordeaux.</p>

<p>It was well worth seeing, that little armada, and
so Nelson thought. He couldn’t see it all at once,
for the two destroyers plowing ahead were so
far away that he caught only occasional frisky
glimpses of their rolling sticks or the fluttering
ribbons of their oily smoke, and one ship had a
mean way of hiding another. But he could see
enough to get a fine proud thrill. The convoys
encompassed the transports as collies herd a flock
of sheep. In the lead were the two destroyers,
while along the flanks were the four cruisers.
Two other destroyers plunged along behind. So
they steamed until darkness, when, obeying the
good night instructions of the flagship, the convoys
quartered off toward the rim of the world
and the liners increased their intervals. But in
the morning the destroyers came scampering back
and the cruisers closed in again. That was a
blustery, pitch-and-toss day, and Nelson, gazing
across after gun drill, felt a bit sorry for those
landsmen cooped up on the rolling top-heavy
troopships. In such weather, he reflected grimly,
there must be many absent from roll-call!</p>

<p>There were few excitements that day, and only
once was a gun fired. Then what the target really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
was Nelson never knew, for the destroyer was far
away and seemed to be firing at the horizon. By
afternoon staring across the water at the nearest
transport palled and even the lookouts slouched
despondently at their stations and the watch officers
yawned behind their hands and seemed to
be asking of the gray skies if it was for this that
they had left their cosy firesides! Another night
and they were looking for the landfall. More
than once on that voyage Nelson’s thoughts had
dwelt on the events of that tragic night, now almost
eleven months ago when the <i>Jonas Clinton</i>
had met her fate and he had last seen his father.
Doubtless the <i>Gyandotte</i>, since leaving Queenstown,
had passed within a hundred miles of the
spot, and for all he knew some of the wreckage
they had sighted might have been from the
schooner. Wind and current play strange tricks
with flotsam. Doubtless his nearness to the <i>Clinton’s</i>
grave accounted for the fact that his father
was a great deal in his mind just then. He still
managed to cling to the conviction that Captain
Troy was alive, although as time passed and no
word nor sign reached him the conviction grew
weaker. But he had not yet given up hope. Perhaps
so long as positive proof was wanting he
never would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>The dim, blue shore-line of France crept up
above the misty edge of the sea about mid-day
and that evening they were anchored in the broad
estuary of the Gironde. It was early morning before
the tide favored and the transports and one
convoy rattled their winches and steamed up the
river. The other ships slept at their anchors until
daylight and then turned their bows seaward once
more. When Nelson looked through a port in
the morning he found the <i>Gyandotte</i> lying in sight
of the picturesque, red-roofed city of Bordeaux.</p>

<small>TIP, OF THE “SANS SOUCI”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The next day Nelson went sight-seeing.
He started out with a liberty party that
filled several boats, but lost them somewhere
ashore and presently found himself wandering
along the river street alone. There was
so much to see, however, that he failed to notice
the absence of his companions for some time.
It was a revelation to find that his country had
built docks and ways, coal yards and cranes and
great storehouses in which to pile the tons and
tons of supplies that were landed almost every
day from the big cargo boats. He found the
transports which they had accompanied through
the submarine zone empty of troops, lying along
the river and preparing to speed back for a new
load. Many were coaling, others were awaiting
their turns. He learned that the boys in khaki
had debarked the day before and had marched
out of town to the big camp which had been built
for them. In fact, at times yesterday he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
heard the bugles and the strains of the regimental
bands as the men had formed on the docks and
gone marching away across the bridge and over
the hill.</p>

<p>A United States uniform, army or navy, was
sufficient voucher to carry its wearer almost anywhere,
he found. The French folk smiled and
murmured “<i lang="fr">Bon jour!</i>” and every face seemed to
hold a welcome. Nelson wished he knew more
French; wished, too, that he was more courageous
with the little he did know! The coalyards and
dockyards were guarded by United States Marines,
and with several of these Nelson conversed.
They weren’t exactly enthusiastic about their work,
for they all wanted something more exciting, or,
at least, more diversified, than standing guard
over piers. But they spoke hopefully of better
times. “We aren’t worrying,” said one chap, a
tow-headed youth who showed more curiosity
about the standing of the Chicago American baseball
team than anything else. “Pershing’ll have
us out of here pretty quick. Anyone can do this
job. We’re fighters and we’ll be needed at the
front before long. Meanwhile we’re doing pretty
well for ourselves. This is a nice old burg and
the folks are mighty decent to us.”</p>

<p>Further along beyond the big locks a huge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
transport that had been a German liner a few
months ago was taking on coal. Nelson’s uniform
gained him admittance at the gate and he
looked on for some time. Coaling ship by machinery
was, he decided, a pretty easy proposition
compared to doing it by hand. Presently his attention
was attracted by a squad of workers in
gray uniforms who appeared on the scene. There
were about forty of them in all and a half-dozen
picturesque French soldiers, carrying guns with
extremely long bayonets, were in charge. For an
instant Nelson was puzzled. Then it dawned on
him that he was looking on his first batch of German
prisoners, and he moved nearer. A great
pile of coal-blackened planks which had been used
on some ship to form temporary bunkers was to
be moved away from the front of the dock to a
storage place beyond, and at this the prisoners
were set. As they passed Nelson, two men to a
plank, they looked dirty but cheerful. Evidently
they preferred such a task to holding down a
muddy trench somewhere on the Front. And,
doubtless, they were getting enough to eat, which,
if the tales one heard were true, would not have
been the case had they been back in their own
country. Nelson couldn’t manage to work up
much enmity against them: they looked too commonplace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
and dull. Many of them viewed him
with mild curiosity as they passed, and one or two
grinned. The guards leaned on their rifles and
merely watched. Escape would probably have
been impossible, since a marine was stationed at
every outlet, and, for that matter, it was extremely
doubtful, Nelson thought, whether they wanted to
escape!</p>

<p>Presently he moved across to where the new
pile was forming. The prisoners worked methodically
but slowly. When out of ear-shot of the
guards they conversed in low tones. One of their
number, a round-faced youth of twenty-two or
thereabouts, was working by himself, carrying
long iron bolts. Nelson observed that he wasn’t
overburdening himself and that he looked quite
satisfied with conditions. The second time he
passed he looked across at Nelson, smiled and
said: “Hello, kid!” Nelson said “Hello” in reply
before he was struck with the oddity of the
phrase from the lips of a German prisoner of war.
Coming back again the youth stopped.</p>

<p>“How’s everything in America?” he asked. He
spoke with very little accent.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Nelson.</p>

<p>“I used to live there,” went on the other. “St.
Louis. Great town, St. Louis. I lived there eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
years. Say, were those American soldiers on those
ships?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Honest?”</p>

<p>Nelson replied in the affirmative again and the
German looked thoughtful. “If that’s true they
lied to us,” he said. “In Berlin they told us the
Yankees wouldn’t come. They say that yet, I
think. Are you telling the truth?”</p>

<p>“Of course! If you’ve lived in St. Louis you
ought to know an American soldier when you see
one.”</p>

<p>The other shook his head. “I never saw any
when I was there. Well, I guess this war won’t
last much longer, eh?”</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>“So do I. I’ve had three years of it.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been a prisoner?” asked
Nelson.</p>

<p>“Four months. It’s better than fighting.” He
grinned and winked. “There was an American
in the prison camp where I was guard last Winter
who used to say the United States would be in the
war this Summer, but I didn’t believe him. He
was a sailor, like you, but not in the Navy. Now
I know that he was right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“What sort of a looking man was he?” asked
Nelson.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was a tall, oldish man. I must go on
or Frenchie will stick me with his bayonet.”</p>

<p>“Wait! What was his name, this man you
speak of?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I never knew his name. He
had a number, but I forget it. He was all right.
Nice man. Ship’s captain, I think. Tall, big
fellow, with——”</p>

<p>There was a shout from the direction of the
water and one of the guards came running toward
them, bayonet lowered. The German laughed
and moved on to receive a scolding. Having finished
with the prisoner, the guard hurried toward
Nelson. He was polite but stern and talked so
fast that, even had Nelson understood French, he
would not have been able to follow him. But the
meaning was apparent. It was forbidden to speak
with the prisoners. Nelson tried haltingly to explain
that the prisoner in question had information
of interest to him, but he couldn’t begin to
find enough words, and the guard evidently knew
no English save “No”; and afterwards Nelson
decided that he hadn’t even been saying “No,”
but “Non”!</p>

<p>Nelson lingered about a few minutes longer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
but on his next trip the German sedulously avoided
his vicinity, and, as the guards were watching him
closely every moment, he finally gave up the attempt
and made his way forth again. Of course,
he reflected, it was probably only a coincidence.
There were doubtless many Americans at German
prison camps who had been ship’s captains and
who were tall and “oldish.” Still, he couldn’t get
it out of his head that the man who had predicted
the entry of America into the war was his father.
He determined to get further speech with the
prisoner and tried to think how to arrange for it.
In the end he decided to secure the intercession of
the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> commander, and with that thought
in mind returned to the ship at the first opportunity.
But Fate was against him, for the captain
was on shore and remained there until late that
evening. Nelson took his gun captain, Garey, into
his confidence meanwhile, and Garey was sympathetic
but not overly impressed.</p>

<p>“It’s one chance in a hundred, Troy,” he said.
“Take the average Yankee skipper and it’s dollars
to doughnuts that he’s thin and tall and
middle-aged. You see, about all the American
prisoners the Germans have got so far are men
they’ve taken off ships. It wouldn’t do any harm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
to hear what that Fritz has to say, but I wouldn’t
hope for much. What camp was it?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t tell me. I was going to ask, but
the guard butted in just then.”</p>

<p>“Well, you get speech with the Old Man and
maybe he can fix it for you. He will if he can,
anyway.”</p>

<p>But it wasn’t to be, and Nelson never saw the
round-faced German from St. Louis again. The
next morning, soon after daybreak, the <i>Gyandotte</i>
pulled her anchors up from the bottom of the
Gironde and picked her way down-stream and
through the mine fields and headed back toward
Queenstown.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, after his first disappointment,
Nelson was happier for that chance meeting.
Sometimes he told himself that it was silly to think
that the German had really had speech with his
father, but, as drowning persons clutch at straws,
so Nelson clutched at that little bit of encouragement.
It made life far happier, in any case, and
now that Martin was gone life wasn’t terribly
joyous.</p>

<p>For a month longer the <i>Gyandotte</i> had her base
at Queenstown and spent more than half her time
at sea convoying transports and great cargo ships
back and forth through the danger zone. Six days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
outside followed by three days in port was the
usual rule. Excitement was always just over the
horizon, but seldom appeared to cheer the monotony.
Only once was the <i>Gyandotte</i> engaged with
a U-boat, and that was a long-distance affair that
netted nothing save disappointment. The German
submarine was not anxious for battle and,
after firing four shells wide of the mark, quickly
submerged. The <i>Gyandotte’s</i> fire was no more
deadly than the U-boat’s, nor did the depth bombs
which were later dropped from the cruiser succeed
any better than the shells. All the comfort the
<i>Gyandotte</i> could gain from that brief and unsatisfactory
encounter lay in the fact that the tramp
steamer which had been the U-boat’s intended
prey was rescued.</p>

<p>On every trip there were alarms, and sometimes
a periscope or conning tower was actually sighted.
But always the sub dived before she was in range.
Nelson found himself sympathizing with the destroyer
men who chanted a ditty to the effect that:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We joined the Limie ‘gobs,’ also,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">To battle with the Hun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And now we’re waiting patiently</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">A Fritz who will not run!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But if actual battles were few in the American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
patrol flotilla that Summer and Fall, there was
plenty of incident. Storms became numerous as
Autumn appeared, and the <i>Gyandotte</i> gave the lie
to those pessimists who doubted her seaworthiness.
There were occasions when Nelson concluded
that if he ever reached land again it would
be either in a small boat or atop a deck hatch, but
the little cruiser always came through somehow,
even if she almost stood on her beam ends doing
it! Meanwhile Nelson found promotion of a
sort. A vacancy in the crew of Number Four gun
placed him as trainer, a position for which his
study and Garey’s instructions had well fitted him,
and he blossomed forth with a seaman gunner’s
distinguishing mark, a bursting bomb worked in
white silk on his sleeve. He was rather proud of
that insignia and fairly ached for a chance to
make good at his job.</p>

<p>He received one letter from Martin about the
first of October, mailed at some town on the East
coast of Scotland whose name Nelson could not
decipher, and which, he decided, he wouldn’t have
been able to pronounce in any case. Martin reported
that the <i>Q-4</i> was lying up undergoing battery
replacements. “We’ve had a busy time of it
since I saw you last,” he continued. “We’re helping
the Limie subs patrol this beastly coast around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
here. There’s a big base about twelve miles away
where the British fleet is tucked up, and it’s our
stunt to see that no one slips in and ‘strafes’ them
when they’re having tea. It isn’t bad fun, but
nothing ever happens. They talk about going up
and shelling the German fleet out of its base, but
I guess it’s only talk. It’s none of my business,
but if I was Jellicoe I’d want more action. The
Englishers are a fine lot and we get along with
them top-hole. (I’m getting to talk like one fast!)
But this is a bleak old corner of the world and
we nearly freeze to death when we go out. I
wish they’d change us to the Mediterranean this
Winter. Send me a letter to the address below
and tell me what you’re doing these days. Did
you see that New York had copped the pennant?
Some team, old scout, some team! You remember
Jimmy Sanford, on my crew? He’s the one
with a bald spot in the middle of his head. Well,
Jimmy’s from Chicago and he won’t speak to
anyone since he’s learned that Chicago has lost
the World’s Championship. I’ll be mighty glad
when this shindy is over, old settler. Me for
home the first chance I get. I’m sort of fed up
on this ‘submarinery.’ ‘I know now that dad was
right!’”</p>

<p>Nelson answered the first time he went ashore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
but there came no further response from the distant
Martin. Nelson had made other friends by
now, both aboard the cruiser and ashore, but with
none of them was he very intimate and none took
the place of Martin in his affections. There was
a young English midshipman named Tipper—more
generally known as Tip—with whom Nelson
chummed ashore. Tip was nineteen, a freckle-faced,
tilt-nosed youngster full of fun and enthusiasm.
Tip was aboard the British patrol boat
<i>Sans Souci</i>, the flippant name having, through inadvertency,
been allowed to remain, although
most craft of the kind were distinguished by a
mere number. Tip was second in command of
the <i>Sans Souci</i> and had for superior officer a grave
and reverend Reserve lieutenant of fifty-seven or -eight
years who, if one believed Tip, left such
trifles as navigation in the hands of the junior.
There was a further complement of twelve petty
officers and men, mostly young and enthusiastic,
who apparently begrudged every day that the little
converted yacht spent inside the booms. It was
the <i>Sans Souci’s</i> mission to ride a certain square
section of the sea south of St. George’s Channel,
fair weather or foul, and watch for U-boats, mines
and suspicious characters generally.</p>

<p>Nelson made young Mr. Tipper’s acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
quite by accident in the Y. M. C. A. hut, Tip having
come across a joke in an English weekly which
he felt compelled to share with someone else. As
Nelson happened to be the nearest, Nelson was
chucklingly invited to read the humorous paragraph.
He did so, found it funny, laughed and
was instantly—and metaphorically—clasped to the
breast of the smart, good-looking young midshipman.
The fact that Nelson was not even a petty
officer appeared to have no weight with Tip, who
was surprisingly democratic for a British naval
officer. Later Nelson discovered a kind of explanation,
which was that in Tip’s eyes an American
was quite different from other beings and that
with him the ordinary rules didn’t hold good.
Tip had queer ideas on the subject of American
life and customs, largely due to his reading. He
firmly believed that New York and San Francisco
were, if not adjacent, at least within a day’s journey
of each other, and that anywhere between the
two cities one plunged into trackless forests and
crossed limitless plains inhabited by Indians, cowboys,
“bad men,” panthers, rattlers, alligators and
a variety of less ferocious animals such as elk,
bison and antelope. Somewhere north of the
plains and forests lay a wild pile of mountains,
filled with glaciers and mountain sheep, and beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
those again was a country called Canada,
inhabited by Younger Sons. He surprised Nelson
one day by asking him if he had Indian blood in
him, and was palpably disappointed when Nelson
said no. At first Nelson dubbed his new acquaintance
“a cheerful idiot,” but it didn’t take long to
find that while Tip was undoubtedly cheerful he
was far from being an idiot. Tip had plenty of
money and was happiest when spending it. A
“jolly good feed” was his favorite extravagance,
and Nelson was frequently his guest. Had Tip
had his way Nelson would have been entertained
in the little hotel he had discovered, at every meal
ashore, but Nelson had to refuse many times when
he wanted very much to accept simply because he
didn’t care to be in the other’s debt too greatly.
On thirty-six dollars a month, which was his present
pay as a seaman gunner, he couldn’t play host
very frequently. One day he went out in a very
smart little gig to the <i>Sans Souci</i> and was shown
that diminutive “warship.”</p>

<p>The <i>Sans Souci</i> had once been a rather luxurious
cruising yacht, but luxuries had been shorn
away with a stern hand until now she was little
more than a hull accommodating engine and bunks,
with a small rapid-fire gun mounted on the bow.
In length she was just over the dimension of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
<i>Wanderer</i>. In seaworthiness, however, she appeared
to have the better of that boat. She
burned gasoline—or petrol, as they called it in
those waters—and storage tanks were scattered
all over her, above deck and below. The officers
lived in Spartan simplicity, commander and junior
sharing a tiny stateroom abaft the engine and eating
forward in the galley.</p>

<p>“We have our chunk first, you know,” explained
Tip. “But it’s very seldom we sit down
to it, for when this little lady gets into a sea you
simply can’t keep anything on the table.”</p>

<p>Nelson secretly thought that careening about
the channel in the <i>Sans Souci</i> might be exciting
enough, but he was sort of thankful he didn’t have
to do it. Sailing the waters of Nantucket Sound
in the old <i>Wanderer</i> had been fairly safe work,
but tossing about a hundred miles from land in
this shallop was another thing entirely! He admired
Tip’s pluck but didn’t envy him.</p>

<p>The <i>Sans Souci</i> had been black at one time, and
then the vogue of decorating ship’s hulls with lines
and ripples and spots had come in, and the little
craft was a strange and fearsome thing above the
water line. Tip was very proud of the camouflaging,
though. He had even taken a hand at it
himself, borrowing a brush from the painter and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
adding some gruesome streaks of pea green to the
black, gray, white and blue already there. Tip
claimed that you couldn’t tell the <i>Sans Souci</i> from
a mermaid half a mile distant, and Nelson was
prepared to believe it, even though he had never
seen a mermaid. Lieutenant Putnam-Earle
greeted Nelson politely but failed to accept the
hand that Nelson unthinkingly extended. (“You
mustn’t mind Put,” said his junior afterwards.
“He’s like that. Awf’ly fussy, you know, about
rank and all that rot. Comes of one of our oldest
families. So old it’s fairly putrid. He’s not
a half bad old chap.”) Nelson didn’t allow the
incident to worry him. Of course the lieutenant
had been quite right. A commanding officer
doesn’t shake hands with an ordinary seaman on
being introduced; at least, not on duty. The lieutenant
struck Nelson as being a far from cheerful
companion for a fellow like Tip, and wondered
what it was like to have to live with him for three
days at a stretch at sea. The crew seemed a fine
lot of young Britons, and he could understand a
portion of Tip’s enthusiasm for his command.</p>

<p>As the <i>Sans Souci</i> spent three days on duty and
three days in port alternately, Nelson usually had
a good deal of Tip’s society when the <i>Gyandotte</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
was in Queenstown. Liberty was freely granted
when the cruiser was in port and Nelson and Tip
made several excursions to nearby points of interest,
once getting as far afield as Dublin and once
to Limerick. Cork was a favorite jaunt until the
men of the fleets were forbidden to visit that city
because of Sinn Fein demonstrations. Ireland was
as much <i lang="la">terra incognita</i> to Tip as it was to Nelson,
and they had a good deal of fun in exploring it.</p>

<p>The Limerick trip was made at Tip’s suggestion.
He declared that all his life he had wanted
to go and see where the poetry was made. Once
there, and perched on an outside car, he had inquired
affably of the jarvey where they made the
limericks. “I’d like to see the factory, you know.
We might take home a couple.” This was beyond
the driver, however. He, it appeared, had never
heard of a limerick verse, and didn’t seem to think
very much of those that Tip recited for his benefit.
On the return journey Nelson suggested that
Limerick was not likely to win fame, as Cork had
done, through the medium of one of the verses
named for it, since there was nothing to rhyme
with Limerick. Whereupon Tip had gazed fixedly
out the carriage window for a space and had
then recited triumphantly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There was an old man of Limerick</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Who said: ‘I’m the boy as can trim a rick.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">They gave him a fork,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">But he ran off to Cork.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I forget if his name it was Jim or Mick.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“I guess,” said Nelson, “the supper is on me.”</p>

<p>All the rest of the way back to Queenstown Tip
invented limericks, until Nelson said despairingly
that he wished he had never mentioned the things!</p>

<small>OFF HELIGOLAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The <i>Gyandotte</i> steamed out of Queenstown
one October twilight in company
with four destroyers and headed southeast,
a departure from the usual proceeding that
excited comment and conjecture from one end of
the ship to the other. The bulletin was eagerly
searched, but the Old Man had nothing to say as
yet as regarded destination or duty. It was not
until morning and the <i>Gyandotte</i>, still in company
with the destroyers, was seen to be off the southern
coast of Cornwall that the unprecedented was
known to have happened. So far the <i>Gyandotte</i>
had never dipped her nose into the waters of the
English Channel. Few of the American patrol
boats had, either, for their sphere of activity was
principally to the south and west. Naturally the
rumor that they were to rendezvous with the British
Grand Fleet somewhere in the North Sea for
an attack in force on a German naval base became
current, mainly because that was the thing that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
every man’s heart longed for. All that day they
steamed slowly through treacherous waters, waters
far more populous than those they had been
frequenting. Mine layers and sweepers, sea-planes,
torpedo boats, cargo boats, destroyers,
chasers—they saw them all. They passed within
sight of Plymouth and the Isle of Wight, with
Portsmouth hiding around the corner of it, and
finally Eastbourne, and by that time the coast of
France was clear to the eastward, and a Channel
steamer plowed past them quite as though war
was a thing of the past. The cliffs of Dover
loomed up toward evening, and it was then that
Nelson saw mine sweepers actually at work for
the first time. Directed by a saucy little patrol
yacht, the two blunt-nosed trawlers steamed westward
on parallel courses, a long cable connecting
them. Although Nelson watched eagerly as long
as they were within sight they apparently found
no mines. They were still at it when distance and
twilight hid them from view. Some time that
night the <i>Gyandotte</i> emerged into the North Sea,
for the next morning she was rolling merrily out
of sight of land and the quartet of destroyers
were rolling even more merrily ahead and astern,
stretched out for nearly a mile. Nelson thrilled
at the thought that somewhere to the east of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
was Heligoland and the entrance to the Kiel Canal
and the German navy lying behind its network of
mines in the land-locked harbors. Heligoland
was a word to conjure with, and Nelson peered
into a typical North Sea mist as though he meant
to penetrate to the distant rock by sheer force of
will.</p>

<p>“I bet you it makes England sick,” remarked
Garey, when Nelson mentioned the German naval
base. “She swapped that rock for something, I
forgot what, and I guess she wishes now she’d
kept it, all right. Gee, it’s a cinch for Germany!
They say she spent fifty million dollars on it, making
fortifications and so on. I’ll bet Gibraltar
hasn’t a thing on Heligoland nowadays. Hundreds
of eleven-inch guns they’ve got there, they
say. A lot of good it would be for a fleet to try
to shell that! And a fine chance it would have of
getting around it. Yah, that man Salisbury played
the goat, all right, when he engineered that deal!
Wouldn’t you think the English would have been
afraid to give up an outpost like that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but suppose England still owned it,” objected
Nelson. “Could she have held it today?
It’s almost within gun range of the shore, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“About forty miles, I guess. Sure, she could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
have held it. All she had to do was fortify it just
as Germany has done——”</p>

<p>“But maybe Germany would have objected to
another power fortifying a place so close.”</p>

<p>“Suppose she did object? What could she have
done about it?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know. Appeal to the Hague——”</p>

<p>“Hah! You make me laugh,” jeered Garey.
“If England had kept that rock in the sea this
war would be over.”</p>

<p>“Really? Why?”</p>

<p>“Because Heligoland commands the mouth of
the Kiel Canal and all the harbors along the coast
in that corner where Germany has her ships hiding:
Cuxhaven, Wilhelmshaven and Friedrichskoog,
and the mouth of the Elbe that leads to
Hamburg; and the Weser, too. Why, Germany
couldn’t have found a place on the Atlantic coast
that the English couldn’t have shelled her out of!
As it is now Heligoland gives her a fine anchorage
for warships, a base for submarines and airships
and Zeppelins and destroyers and a signal
outpost. They’ve got searchlights on Heligoland,
they say, that’ll pick up a dory twenty miles away!
Talk about your soft snaps! Germany’s got the
softest ever. She ought to include Lord Salisbury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
in her prayers every night: ‘God bless Lord Salisbury
for letting us have Heligoland!’”</p>

<p>“I’d love to see it,” mused Nelson.</p>

<p>“Well, you aren’t likely to, I guess. If the
<i>Gyandotte</i> started in toward that old rock I’d
hand in my papers and fall overboard! None of
those eleven-inch shells brushing my cap off, thank
you! Nothing doing! Nothing at all!”</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose we’re going?” asked
Nelson.</p>

<p>“Norway, probably, but don’t ask me what for.
Won’t anything happen, anyway. Nothing ever
does on this old skate. All we do is act the nice
old gentleman with the umbrella helping the young
ladies off the street car and escorting them to the
sidewalk. We don’t even get splashed with mud.”</p>

<p>“But,” laughed Nelson, “if you want action
why are you against having a peek at Heligoland?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I want action, but I’m not asking for
sudden death, believe me, Troy! What I’d like
would be a crack at a couple of light cruisers of
about our own size. Or three, for good measure.
But butting your head against a hundred eleven-inch
guns isn’t giving yourself a fair show. It’s
plain suicide.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the British ship <i>Arethusa</i> do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“When was that?”</p>

<p>“The first year of the war, I think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that! Take it from me, Troy, the <i>Arethusa</i>
didn’t go near enough that little rock to be
seen. That was off the North Frisians, if I remember,
and the British ships were careful to
pick out a fine misty day. The <i>Arethusa</i> did well,
though. I’m not saying she wasn’t a plucky one.
As I figure that little ruction, this fellow Beatty—wasn’t
he the chap that time?—had his big ships
waiting outside in case the Germans showed fight.
The <i>Arethusa</i> went in close to draw ’em out. She
did it, too, for a couple of German cruisers met
her and smeared her considerable. Then she
backed out and had tea and fixed things up and
went back to it. And they say—and I guess it’s
right—that she ‘strafed’ the two Fritzes before
she called it a day. Sank one and set the other
afire. There were other ships mixed up in that
row: the <i>Lion</i>, the <i>Queen Mary</i>, the <i>Invincible</i>,
I think it was, and some more. And I dare say
there were destroyers barking around, too. And
German subs, maybe. I guess it was a pretty
scrap, all right, only it was so foggy and dark no
one could see who they were fighting. The British
did for three German cruisers and some destroyers,
and she took hundreds of prisoners; old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
Admiral von Turpentine’s son among them. But
I never heard how many ships the British lost,
except from Berlin, and you can’t believe what
Berlin says. But I’m betting the Johnnie Bulls
didn’t get very close to old Mr. Heligoland!”</p>

<p>“One did,” remarked Nelson. “The <i>Liberty</i>.”</p>

<p>“Did, eh? <i>Liberty?</i> Sounds like one of ours.
I don’t remember her.”</p>

<p>“Well, she was only a little destroyer, Garey.
But she waltzed straight in under those guns and
tried to torpedo the big ships lying in the harbor.
And she kept on until she had only one round of
ammunition left and one torpedo in her tubes.
Then she turned tail and beat it back. She lost
her commander and three of her crew, but she
lived to tell the story in spite of all the eleven-inch
shells they plumped down on her; enough, I
guess, to sink her twice over if they’d hit her!”</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” asked Garey.
“Say, she was some little kid, what? Well, you’ve
got to hand it to the British for pluck. I always
say that. And, say, that <i>Liberty</i> ship was well
named, wasn’t she? I wouldn’t wonder if she
was an American destroyer they’d borrowed from
us, or something. Anyway, I’ll bet more than
half the ‘gobs’ were Irish!”</p>

<p>There’s always a nasty, choppy sea running in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
that stretch of water hemmed in by the British
Isles and the coasts of Germany and Denmark.
Shallow and treacherous and generally vile, it is
abhorred by sailors the world over, and those on
the <i>Gyandotte</i> could find nothing good to say of
it. All that day the mist held and hid everything
a mile or so distant, and the lookouts never kept
their eyes peeled any more thoroughly than they
did while the line of ships steamed on toward the
north. It was an area well infested with German
submarines, while it was no unusual thing for a
pack of destroyers to dart out from one of the
protected bases on the chance of picking off a lone
prey. But, save that the sharp, short waves kept
the decks wet and made everyone uncomfortable—life
on the destroyers must have been miserable
indeed, Nelson thought—no incident pleasant or
unpleasant broke the monotony. Forty-six hours
after passing Dover the American ships reached
the Skager Rack and dropped anchors off Christiansand,
where, during a long, black night, they
rolled and tumbled miserably. Nelson always recalled
that night as one of the most unpleasant of
his life, for they had suddenly penetrated into
Winter weather and few of the men had as yet
received their heavy clothing. Even below deck
it was cold, and in the hammocks sleep was a chill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
nightmare. Pitch and toss and freeze was the
program that night, and not a man aboard but
longed for daylight. Ferris, for once supplied
with something to be thoroughly pessimistic about,
fairly outdid himself!</p>

<p>The next morning, which dawned bright and
frostily clear, the ships sought calmer quarters
and in the afternoon liberty was granted and the
little city was over-run with Jackies. The attitude
of the inhabitants puzzled Nelson. They appeared
friendly, or, certainly, not unfriendly, but
kept oddly aloof and were uncommunicative to a
degree. The men on all ships had been specially
and strictly cautioned as to behavior, and as a
result the Christiansand folks had nothing to
complain of on that score. Ferris remarked
gloomily that they were “a frosty lot,” and reckoned
they never got quite thawed out after the
long Winters.</p>

<p>Towards five o’clock word went around that
warships were coming up from southward, and
there was much activity along the harbor front.
A Norwegian gunboat of a very ancient vintage
rolled out to sea, apparently, as one of the <i>Gyandotte’s</i>
crew said, “to give ’em the once over.”
Evidently the gunboat was satisfied. Or else she
thought discretion the better part of valor. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
either case, she was soon hiking back to the protection
of the fort, looking immensely relieved.
It was nearly six o’clock before the newcomers
revealed themselves beyond question as British
destroyers. They slap-banged cheerfully through
the channel and came about and slid to anchorage
amidst the American ships with a dash that
brought cheers of admiration as well as welcome
from the latter. The British “gobs” cheered back
and for several minutes the staid old harbor was
extremely noisy and ribald. Signal flags fluttered,
boatswain’s pipes <em>peep-peeped</em>, bugles called, and
winches rattled and hummed. And along the
shore the mild-eyed and annoyingly self-contained
citizens looked on curiously. Perhaps they suspected
an Allied attack. If they did their demeanor
was a model of coolness.</p>

<p>On the <i>Gyandotte</i> the side boys lined up, the
boatswain trilled merrily and the Old Man and
the luff went over the side into a gig and were
pulled away to the British flagship, a three-stacked
destroyer with great high bows and a veritable
bulwark of depth charges lined amidship. Nelson
wondered hard what it all meant, and his heart
thumped like a hammer several times when he
realized the possibilities. The combined forces
included a light cruiser and ten destroyers, enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
thought Nelson hopefully to provide some lively
times if the enemy was sighted. He climbed into
his hammock at midnight, however, with curiosity
still unappeased, and the next day was quite uneventful.
One might have thought that the American
and British ships had made an appointment
at Christiansand merely to enjoy an uninterrupted
palaver. The northern sunlight made gay with
fluttering bunting, small boats crossed from ship
to ship and the harbor had a most holiday appearance.
On shore, Limie “gobs” and American
tars fraternized and swapped yarns and rode on
the tram cars or in carriages and saw the sights
very happily. Not until late in the day was the
disappointing truth made known. Then from
eastward, probably out of Christiania, lumbered
fourteen Norwegian cargo boats, each well down
in the water and each fairly shrieking its nationality
in great white letters along its hull. And this
was what the <i>Gyandotte</i> and all the destroyers
had come hundreds of miles for! To escort a lot
of freighters across the North Sea! It was fairly
disgusting!</p>

<p>The cargo boats, which ranged from big to
little, passed on down the Rack, exchanging signals
with the flagship, and went out of sight in the early
darkness, and for awhile Nelson hoped against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
hope. But presently the bugle called, winches
clattered all over the harbor and the fleet followed.
Nelson could have wept. The fine adventure
had come to nothing in the end but the
old, old story: convoying! Ferris summed it up
in one bitter word: “<em>Stung!</em>”</p>

<small>THE BATTLE IN THE NORTH SEA</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Nelson reached the deck confused, half-awake.
In his ears was the terrific wailing
sound that had sent him instinctively
tumbling from his hammock. For an instant he
blinked and strove to gather scattered faculties.
Up and down the deck hammocks were emptying
and feet padded hurriedly past. He grabbed at
his clothes, his heart leaping as the meaning of
the din came to him. It was General Quarters!
The bugle had taken up the alarm and the quick
notes sounded nearer and nearer. The dim electric
lamps still glowed, but a wan light from open
ports showed daylight outside. Already the
watch was connecting fire hose. Somewhere near
at hand the shrill, piercing shriek of a siren
drowned the gongs and bugles. The shriek rose
and fell deafeningly and grew fainter. Nelson
knew without seeing that a destroyer had dashed
past them astern. The rudder chains were groaning,
and from the engine rooms came a louder hum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
and clatter. Sleep was gone now, and he hurried
to his station. Shells were already coming up,
and as Nelson fell in the command of “<em>Stations!</em>”
was given. Through the port, as he sprang to
the training wheel, lay a segment of choppy, drab
ocean across which a gray destroyer was hurtling
with clouds of oily smoke whirling back from her
four stacks. A leaden sky was overhead and a
sea-mist hung like a curtain a few miles away.
From the destroyer came a flash of pale rosy light
and the sharp bark of a four-inch gun.</p>

<p>“<em>Bore clear!</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Load!</em>”</p>

<p>A geyser of water shot into the air astern of
the destroyer.</p>

<p>“Rotten shooting, Fritz!” muttered a shellman
as he rammed home. Waiting, Nelson peered
tensely into the mist. Once he thought he saw a
gray shadow there, but was not certain. “<em>Ready!</em>”
The officer spoke sharply into the telephone.
Then they waited, plugman, pointer, trainer, sight
setter, shellmen and powdermen. A second destroyer
reeled past at a good thirty knots, a
“Limie” this time, her siren blowing hysterically
as she demanded sea room.</p>

<p>“Gangway for Lord Goldashington,” murmured
the sight setter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly from farther forward came the sharp,
clear explosion of one of the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> bow
guns. Someone behind Nelson growled impatiently.
Then the fire control system awoke to
life.</p>

<p>“Now, then, men! Look alive!” called the
division officer. “Show ’em what Number Four
can do!” Wheels were turning and the gun was
coming swiftly to the unseen target. A moment
of suspense, and then:</p>

<p>“<em>Commence firing!</em>”</p>

<p>It was the United States destroyer <i>Banks</i> whose
foretop lookout, peering into the early morning
mist, had caught sight of a tell-tale streak of
darker gray against the water and had sounded
the warning. Almost by the time the officer on
the bridge had found the object with his glasses
it was gone, but the <i>Banks</i>, signaling the alarm
to the flagship, had swung out of line and gone
tearing off in the direction of the Fritz. The flagship
gave hurried orders and the plan of action
already provided was carried into effect. The
freighters crowded on all steam and went wallowing
southwestward at their best gaits, while every
second convoy swung out of line and went into
action with a fine enthusiasm. For a good two
minutes nothing was seen nor heard of the foe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
but when a torpedo had missed the British destroyer
<i>143</i> by a matter of yards only it was evident
that the <i>Banks’</i> lookout had not been mistaken.
A second torpedo a moment later tore
into the stern of a cargo boat, its direction proving
that the first U-boat was not alone. But none
had sighted the second sub, and after that first
fire the Allied ships became silent and contented
themselves with circling about the supposed lurking
places of the U-boats and dropping depth
bombs. Gray green water spouted over a wide
radius, but the Huns had fled. For twenty minutes
the destroyers dashed here and there, their
sirens shrieking warnings to each other, while the
<i>Gyandotte</i>, for want of anything to fire at, steamed
back to her position, disgruntled. This was at a
quarter past five and about one hundred and fifty
miles west-south-west of the Naze, approximately
57 North and 4 West. The excitement
lasted about one hour, at the end of which time
the destroyers in action sped back after their companions.
On the <i>Gyandotte</i> the command “Secure”
was not given, however, and the crews stood
by the guns. At shortly after six, twenty-two minutes
after by Nelson’s watch, the second engagement
began.</p>

<p>This time three periscopes were sighted almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
simultaneously to the southeast at distances varying
from six hundred to fourteen hundred yards.
Seven torpedoes were seen, three of which found
marks. The steamer <i>Bok Fjord</i>, one of the larger
freighters, was struck amidships and went down
three hours later. A British destroyer, the <i>86</i>,
was put out of action and a second Norwegian,
the <i>Ymir</i>, sustained slight damage. The first
shots at the Germans were well placed but the
U-boats had already submerged. Depth charges
were again dropped and, it was believed, one sub
was accounted for. A quarter of an hour after
the first alarm was given lookouts spied smoke
above the low bank of mist to the eastward, which
presently evolved itself into a flotilla of enemy
ships. These consisted of eight destroyers and
three light cruisers, and at about seven the first
shells from the latter were fired. Eight of the
Allied ships, seven destroyers and the <i>Gyandotte</i>,
had immediately left the convoy and steamed to
meet them, scattering so as to cover the merchantmen
which, with the exception of the <i>Bok Fjord</i>,
were all able to keep their course. This third
engagement became general at seven-fifteen.</p>

<p>The <i>Gyandotte</i> opened up at six thousand
yards, by which time she had been struck once
without much damage, finding herself opposed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
a slightly more formidable cruiser which afterwards
proved to be the <i>Dornburg</i>. Separate engagements
soon developed, with several of the
smaller German destroyers hanging back during
the first phase of the battle and firing at long
range without much execution. A calm sea, with
little wind, made for good sighting, but smoke
hung close to the surface and frequently obscured
the target. The <i>Gyandotte</i> used only her bow
guns at first, drawing the <i>Dornburg</i> away to the
southeast. Superior speed gave an advantage to
the latter, however, and she was eventually able
to choose her position. The <i>Gyandotte</i> stood off
under a heavy broadside fire and brought her
stern guns to bear, and finally her starboard
broadside. Her marksmanship was proving superior,
although the <i>Dornburg</i> had the advantage
of more guns. The two ships drew southwestward,
firing at about five thousand yards, and
continued on that course until the <i>Dornburg</i>, having
been thrice hulled amidships, showed distress
and was evidently unable to answer to her helm.
She turned westward and sought to escape, but
the <i>Gyandotte</i>, taking up a position to starboard,
held a parallel course and, while suffering severe
damage herself, soon had the <i>Dornburg</i> at her
mercy. After forty minutes, during which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
two ships had drawn some ten miles from the main
engagement, the <i>Dornburg</i> was seen to be on fire
aft. She was now using only three stern guns
and these were presently silent, and from the
<i>Gyandotte</i> they could see the crew assembling forward.
By this time the after part of the German
cruiser was hidden by smoke clouds. An explosion
of ammunition tore a gaping hole forward
of the mainmast and a minute later the cruiser
listed to port. The <i>Gyandotte</i> withheld her fire
and demanded surrender. To this there was no
reply. A band assembled and the strains of the
“Watch on the Rhine” floated from the doomed
ship. Already many of the crew were going
overboard, although apparently no order had as
yet been given. The <i>Gyandotte</i> lowered boats,
but a new enemy appeared and they were recalled.
A blue-gray destroyer of some nine hundred tons
was bearing down from the northward and the
<i>Gyandotte</i> at once engaged her. This action was
short, for the destroyer was twice hulled at seven
thousand yards, and, although she kept ahead for
awhile, firing from bow guns and launching two
torpedoes, she presently turned tail and made off
toward the coast. Her shots did small damage
and neither torpedo struck, although one came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
the surface within a few yards of the <i>Gyandotte’s</i>
bow.</p>

<p>The <i>Dornburg’s</i> commander refused to surrender
and the <i>Gyandotte</i> again lowered away
boats. By this time the crew of the German ship
were going overboard <i lang="fr">en masse</i> and the ship was
well down by the stern. The <i>Gyandotte</i> picked
up one hundred and forty-four officers and men,
while a large number went down and many dead
and wounded remained aboard. The <i>Dornburg</i>
sunk at eight-fifty. Her captain stayed with her,
but was rescued a few minutes later apparently
none the worse for his heroism. The <i>Gyandotte</i>
attended to her own wounds, many but mostly
superficial, and rejoined the flotilla shortly before
nine. She had lost one officer and twelve men and
had more than twenty injured. Two guns were
out of commission and an explosion below deck
had wrecked a port boiler. Two compartments
were flooded when she made her way back.
Above deck she was pretty well littered, for the
<i>Dornburg’s</i> fire had been high.</p>

<p>What had been going on during her engagement
was not at first apparent, but as she drew
nearer the scene of action it was evident that the
Germans had had all they wanted. Three destroyers
were fleeing to the eastward, dropping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
mines as they went, pursued by two British craft,
firing with telling effect. Northward a fourth had
surrendered, while, fair in the course of the <i>Gyandotte</i>,
poking her nose through the mist, a German
light cruiser was in flames. The <i>Gyandotte</i>
picked up signals and veered to the westward
where the merchantmen were doggedly holding
their course. As it turned out later, they had had
their troubles, they and the ships left to guard
them, for a U-boat had again attacked and had
got home on a fourth freighter which, as the
<i>Gyandotte</i> drew near, was spouting smoke forward.
Three miles away a destroyer was circling
in a vain endeavor to find the sub, while two
others were standing by the burning ship.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the engagement was over, having
occupied just under four hours and resulted in a
decisive victory for the Allied forces. Germany
had lost two of three cruisers and three of eight
destroyers. Of the latter, one was captured and
was later able to reach Newcastle under her own
power. The cruisers, <i>Dornburg</i> and <i>Ernten</i>,
sank, the latter, slightly larger than the <i>Gyandotte’s</i>
adversary, first burning to the water’s
edge. Of the Allied ships, the British destroyer
<i>Jade</i> was sunk by a torpedo and the <i>276</i>, attacked
simultaneously by a destroyer and cruiser, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
fairly riddled before a lyddite fire broke out and
caused her abandonment. She was ultimately torpedoed
and sunk by the flagship. Of the United
States ships only the <i>Grayson</i> was lost. She was
made helpless early in the battle when a shell tore
away her whole stern. Attempts to tow her out
of range were unsuccessful, and, in spite of the
efforts of her officers and crew to save her, she
sank shortly after. The Allies lost four officers
and thirty-one men and had upwards of sixty injured.
Against this the German loss was approximately
eighty dead, of which fully a third were
drowned, over a hundred injured and two hundred
and seventy-two taken prisoner. Of the
cargo boats the <i>Bok Fjord</i> was sunk and three
others more or less seriously damaged, with a loss
of six lives and injury to as many more. Temporary
repairs were effected by one o’clock, by
which time the warships were again in formation
and the flotilla was headed back on its course
under reduced speed.</p>

<p>Wireless messages had been picked up promptly
and soon after one o’clock four destroyers came
boiling out of the west. Too late to get into the
scrap, after a two hundred mile race at thirty-two
knots or better, the Limies looked the dejection
they undoubtedly felt as they wheeled around behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
the columns and followed to within sight of
the coast. There were no more alarms, and the
convoy dropped anchor off Tynemouth at daybreak
the next morning.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Nelson was watching the disembarkation
of the prisoners after breakfast
when an orderly tapped him on the
arm. “Report to the Exec, Troy,” he said.</p>

<p>“What? Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Where would he be? Sitting on the for’ard
funnel warming his feet, of course. Get a move
on!”</p>

<p>Nelson didn’t find the Executive Officer where
the orderly said, perhaps because he didn’t look
for him there. Instead, he went aft and paused
before a door opening from the wardroom passage,
brushing an imaginary speck from his overshirt
and adjusting a gauze bandage which, running
diagonally across his forehead above his
right eye, gave him a somewhat reckless look.
Then, the door being open, he saluted and: “Ordered
to report to you, sir,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Come in. What’s the name?”</p>

<p>“Troy, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>“Right.” The lieutenant-commander swung
about in his swivel chair and scrutinized Nelson
swiftly. “You are trainer of Number Four gun
crew?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You are mentioned in the Gunnery Officer’s
report, Troy. Tell me what happened yesterday
morning on your station.”</p>

<p>“The enemy got a five-inch shell into us, sir,
about thirty feet forward of Number Four gun.
The explosion killed two of our crew, Hoskins
and Maynard, and wounded our division officer
and four men.”</p>

<p>“I see. Your gun captain was wounded, too,
wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but he’s doing finely.”</p>

<p>“After that shell came aboard you were minus
six of your number then: plugman, pointer, two
shellmen——”</p>

<p>“Sight setter, sir, and one powderman.”</p>

<p>“What happened then?”</p>

<p>Nelson hesitated. “The injured were removed,
sir——”</p>

<p>“The gun was not damaged?”</p>

<p>“Firing circuit was broken, but we got that repaired
pretty quick.”</p>

<p>“I see.” The Executive Officer glanced at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
paper that lay on the deck beside him. “And
after making repairs you and others continued to
serve the gun until the end of the engagement?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who took command?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir. I seemed to be—I thought it was
up to me, sir.”</p>

<p>“How many were with you?”</p>

<p>“Three, sir, until they got word that we were
short-handed. Then they sent us four more men.”</p>

<p>“How long were you short-handed, Troy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. About twenty minutes,
maybe.”</p>

<p>“Make any hits during that time?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we didn’t miss many. We were firing
pretty slow, though, because Scott, one of the
powdermen, who took the plug, didn’t understand
it at first. And we had no shellman.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?”</p>

<p>“I pointed, sir, and Jennings trained; and we all
helped at loading.”</p>

<p>“You were hurt, too?”</p>

<p>“Not much, sir. A bit of shell cut my head a
little.”</p>

<p>“The Gunnery Officer reports that ‘Seaman
Gunner Troy, Naval Reserve, then took command
and with three other seamen, made repairs to electrical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
circuit and served gun for upwards of half
an hour.’ You estimate the time at twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>“It might have been a half-hour, sir.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bit difficult to judge the passage of time
under some circumstances.” The officer smiled.
“In any case you did good work, Troy, and I shall
take pleasure in recommending you for promotion.”</p>

<p>Nelson flushed. “Thank you, sir,” he murmured.
Then: “I didn’t do any more than Jennings
and Scott and Farley, sir,” he disclaimed.
“They——”</p>

<p>“I understand. I have their names, too. That’s
all, Troy.”</p>

<p>Nelson saluted and made his way out. In the
passage he looked down at his right sleeve and
tried to vision a white silk eagle and a single red
chevron and, possibly, the crossed cannons of a
gunner’s mate. He smiled happily as he went on
to pay a visit to Garey and tell him of his good
fortune. The gun captain had been wounded in
the left arm, but a week would put him right.</p>

<p>The <i>Gyandotte</i> laid up at South Shields for
three days, during which time the sound of pneumatic
drills and hammers made life hideous.
Then there was painting to be done over the new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
plates. Ashore the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> crew swaggered
a little, less from vanity than from a sense of
pleasure in having contributed their bit, and no
longer had to sit mum while “Limie” men told of
desperate deeds in the North Sea. A message of
praise from their own Admiral and one from the
British Admiral were posted, and they learned
that they had “worthily upheld the traditions of
the United States Navy.” The public, however,
received a very meager account of that engagement.</p>

<p>The <i>Gyandotte</i> hurried back to Queenstown as
soon as repairs were completed and reported for
duty. It may have been imagination, but it really
seemed to Nelson that the little battle-tried cruiser
held herself more cockily than usual when she
steamed between the forts that afternoon. Two
days later she was pounding the seas off Cape
Clear, bound west to meet another covey of nervous
transports, and the monotony of the old life
threatened again.</p>

<p>Two trips to the border of the danger zone she
made before an incident worth recording occurred,
and then the incident was of more interest
to Nelson than to others aboard. They were
steaming westward, some eighty miles from the
Cape at the time. Ahead and astern were three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
destroyers and two cruisers. The sea was as
much like a mill-pond as it ever gets in that locality,
where fathoms are few, and a bright late
October sun made dancing ripples across the
water as it climbed into the eastern sky. It was
at about half-past seven when a lookout reported
to the bridge that what seemed to be a small boat
was in sight to the north. Signals were exchanged
with the four-stack cruiser behind and
presently the <i>Gyandotte</i> left her place and bore
northward toward where a tiny dark speck lay
on the blue ocean.</p>

<p>Rescuing “strafed” mariners in open boats had
long since become an old story, but one never
knew what would be revealed in the way of suffering
and pathos, and as the cruiser drew near the
little boat the officers and men flocked to the rail.
At a quarter of a mile distant the tiny craft seemed
empty, but the foretop lookout reported persons
in the bottom of the boat. The <i>Gyandotte</i> gave
a questioning blast and, in answer, an arm appeared
above the gunwale and waved feebly. As
the cruiser slowed and began to turn a boat was
lowered and presently was pulling lustily for the
derelict. Reaching it, the rescuers made a line
fast to the bow and brought it alongside in tow,
and then those on deck could see what was there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>It was a tiny boat, no larger than a yacht’s
tender. In the bottom of it were five forms, three
sailors and two officers. At first glance life
seemed to have departed from all of them, but
as they were lifted out two showed consciousness.
Quickly they were raised aboard and carried to
the hospital: an elderly officer whose salt-stained
uniform showed him to be a British Naval Reserve
lieutenant, a younger man with the insignia
of a midshipman and three sailors. Something
in the appearance of the younger officer stirred
Nelson’s memory and he thrust himself through
the throng for a closer look. And as he did so,
the midshipman, being borne past, opened his eyes
for a brief instant and his listless gaze encountered
Nelson’s face, and in that instant recognition
flickered in the blue eyes. Then the lids fell
again wearily and he passed from sight, and Nelson,
steadying himself against a stanchion, felt
sick and faint. For the gray countenance had
been that of Tip!</p>

<p>Nelson spent a miserable half-hour before he at
last got word with one of the hospital apprentices
and asked for news.</p>

<p>“Eh?” said the apprentice. “Him? Oh, he’ll
pull through. The old chap’s been dead two days,
though, I guess. One of the sailors, too. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
midshipman and one of the others will come
around. We haven’t got their story yet. Too
weak to talk. I reckon a couple of them’ll be taking
their meals regular tomorrow.”</p>

<p>He was very, very glad that Tip would live,
so glad that for a moment he forgot the others.
Then, recalling the somewhat melancholy and
stiff-mannered elderly lieutenant to whom Tip had
introduced him on the <i>Sans Souci</i> that day, he felt
horribly sorry. He wondered what had been the
fate of that gallant little patrol boat, and whether
all the rest of the crew had perished. In the
afternoon he took his courage in hand and made
inquiry of the Medical Officer, explaining his interest.
The officer was very kind and gave Nelson
all the information he had, which was that
Midshipman Tipper was suffering from hunger
and exposure and at the moment was very weak,
but that he was responding excellently to treatment
and that he would undoubtedly be on his
feet in a day or two. Then it was the Medical
Officer’s turn to question, and Nelson told him
what he knew of the rescued men and the <i>Sans
Souci</i>, and the officer made notes.</p>

<p>“We’ll make report,” he said. “Glad to get
the information. I’ll see that you have a chance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
to talk with your friend as soon as he’s in condition
to see you.”</p>

<p>It was not until the second day later, however,
by which time the <i>Gyandotte</i> was headed
eastward once more, while many troopships and
convoys led and followed, that Nelson received
permission to visit Tip. He found him in one
of the officers’ staterooms, whither he had been
removed after a brief stay in the sick bay. He
didn’t look much like the white-faced, hollow-eyed
youth who had been lifted over the side three
days before. He was lying in a berth, partly
dressed, with an American magazine in his hand
when Nelson appeared. The magazine dropped
to the floor and Tip gave a very healthy whoop
of delight as the door swung open.</p>

<p>“Wot cheer, Troy!” he exclaimed. “I thought
you weren’t coming to see a chap.” He reached
forth an eager hand and gave Nelson’s a hard
grip. “Isn’t it rum I should have been picked
up by your ship? I say, when I saw you last I
never looked for this sort of a—whatyoucall it—reunion!
Isn’t it horrible about the poor old
<i>Sans Souci</i>?” His smile faded abruptly and he
shook his head.</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Nelson, seating himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>“That’s so, you don’t know, do you? I’ll spin
the yarn for you in a moment. Tell me first about
yourself. Everything all right? I hear you’re in
line for a petty officership all along of being a
bloomin’ hero awhile back.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about me, Tip. I’m all right.
What happened to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, me? We-ell, it was a rotten bit of luck,
Troy. You know the dear old Luff’s gone?”
Nelson nodded. “Yes, flickered out the first night
we were afloat. Died like a hero, though.” Tip’s
lip trembled. “Troy, if—if the Lord doesn’t
make ’em pay for all the wickedness they’ve
done——” He swallowed hard, and then the old
smile flooded back. “They got us a week ago
today—no, a week ago yesterday. We were
jaunting along all cozy about twenty miles so’-west
of St. Gowan’s Head. It was a fine moonlight
night and the sea was decently calm and the
dear little tub was doing her standard of twelve
knots. There was one of our destroyers running
close to starboard and she’d just blinked us to
keep off when Nutley, who was standing lookout
for’ard, gave a yell. I was on the bridge
and didn’t hear what he shouted, but I ordered
hard aport, taking a chance, as you’d say. I
fancy it wouldn’t have made a pennyworth of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
difference what I’d ordered, for the ‘moldie’ was
right under us before Nutley saw it. It struck
us amidship and broke us fair in two. We never
saw hide nor hair of the ‘fish’ that did it. We
just made an infernal noise and went down in
about two minutes, like a match you’d broken
in the middle. Most of the men were killed by
the explosion, but there was Nutley and Grogan
and me for’ard and out of it, for some reason.
The bridge went half-way up to the signal pole,
with me clinging to it, and came down in pieces.
Nutley was cutting the lashings of the boat—we
had only the one—and Grogan was tangled up in
the wheel. I made a flying leap below, and I could
see the water boiling up already where the bottom
was ripped, and got the dear old Luff out. Another
chap, Milton, an awfully decent fellow,
bobbed up alongside and we five got into the boat.
By that time the destroyer was signaling and trying
to pick us up with her searchlight, but for some
unknown reason she didn’t come near us. You
wait till I get the Admiralty’s ear, rot her! We
lay around for a long while and tried to find some
more of our men, but they didn’t come up. Finally,
about two in the morning, we started to make
Lundy Island, the nearest land. But the wind
came up before we were half-way there and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
were only Nutley and me to row and only two
oars and a piece of a third, and the sea was making
fast. Seeing we couldn’t reach Lundy, we
tried keeping her headed south, thinking we’d
fetch Penzance or somewhere down there. But
the wind blew us straight out and we couldn’t do
a thing. The Lieutenant died about four o’clock.
He’d been rather badly hurt, ’though I didn’t
know how badly then. I wasn’t very fit myself.
Nutley was the only one of us in decent shape, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“Milton, poor chap, died the next forenoon.
You wouldn’t believe that we could have blown all
the way from about ten miles this side of Lundy
to where you found us and never seen a sail. That’s
what we did, though. Practically, at any rate.
That first night—meaning the second night, really—we
saw lights twice and used up all the matches
we had trying to make a flare. After that we had
all we could do to keep in the boat, for a beastly
storm came up and we thought we were done for.
Not that we’d have cared much, anyway. We saw
Fastnet Light through the rain, but it was ten
miles away at least. The next morning we were
out of sight of land and didn’t know where we
were. We hadn’t any water and hadn’t any food,
and—oh, it was pretty bad, Troy! Grogan kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
going until the evening before you got us. Then
he went off. That left just Nutley and me. We
wanted to get rid of the others to lighten the boat,
but we couldn’t lift them. That morning when
you sighted us I was saying my prayers, or trying
to. I thought Nutley was dead, too. He didn’t
answer when I spoke to him. He says I didn’t
speak, but he’s quite wrong. Well, you know the
rest.”</p>

<p>“It must have been awful,” said Nelson. “Is
the man you spoke of all right now? Nutley, I
mean?”</p>

<p>“Right as a trivet. But it makes a chap a bit
serious to think that out of fourteen of us only
two are alive today. Well, as our friends the
French say, it is the war.”</p>

<p>“What will you do now?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“Get back to Queenstown first, I fancy, and
then try hard to get a command of my own. I
say, I’d like that, what? There’s no reason why
I shouldn’t have it, you know. Lots of chaps
not half so brilliant and clever as I am have command
of chasers.”</p>

<p>“You sort of hate yourself, don’t you?” laughed
Nelson.</p>

<p>Tip grinned. “You’ve got to be a bit cocky or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
you don’t get anything. Wait till I have a chin
with the dear old Admiral!”</p>

<p>“Bet you he will put you in irons,” jeered the
other.</p>

<p>“Take you, Yank! Now what about that stunt
of yours when you licked the German Navy alone
and unassisted? Er, what is it you say? Come—come
over, eh?”</p>

<p>“Come across?”</p>

<p>“Right-o! Come across!”</p>

<small>MART TURNS UP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">After that Tip and Nelson managed to
be together a good deal, for although visiting
the officers’ quarters was something
Nelson didn’t attempt again, there was nothing
to keep Tip from seeking out Nelson. Consequently,
when the latter was off watch Tip was always
on hand to share his idleness. In the few days
that he remained aboard the <i>Gyandotte</i> the young
midshipman became a favorite with officers and
men alike. He was such a sunny, smiling, happy-go-lucky
youth that it would have been impossible
not to like him. Nelson suspected that the ship’s
officers would gladly have kept Tip in the wardroom
on many occasions when that youth was
down on the lower deck with Nelson or, eagerly
curious, following Garey around Number Four
gun and listening to the plugman’s explanations.</p>

<p>There was just one exciting half-hour on the
eastward run, and that came at dusk of the day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
that brought them in sight of the French coast.
A U-boat appeared quite brazenly a mile northward
and it fell to the lot of the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> gunners
to fire the first shot. Tip stood by on that
occasion while Number Four gun crew got into
action and while Nelson, now pointer, landed two
five-inch shells on the patch of water that a moment
before had held a sinking conning tower.
That the shells did any damage is doubtful, nor
were the three destroyers that raced to the spot
any more successful with depth bombs. But the
submarine didn’t discharge any torpedoes, or, if
she did, they went wild, and while the escort
combed the sea the eighteen big transports, filled
with Canadian troops, fled zig-zagging to safety.</p>

<p>The next morning the transports were safe within
the nets and the convoys scattered to their bases,
the <i>Gyandotte</i> following four of the destroyers up
the coast by Penmarch Point, across the Channel
entrance and past the Scilly Islands and so home to
the green-rimmed waters of Queenstown.</p>

<p>Nelson found promotion awaiting him, as did
four others, as a result of the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> North
Sea engagement. It was no longer Seaman Gunner
Troy, but Third Class Gunner’s Mate Troy,
and he was soon wearing his single chevron and
the crossed cannons on his sleeve and trying to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
avoid looking down at them when anyone was
around. In honor of the advancement, Tip took
him to dinner on shore and they made a very
splendid occasion of it. Tip was still in the dark
as to what was to happen to him, and spoke scathingly
of the Admiralty because of its indifference
to his future. Meanwhile, however, he seemed
to be getting along very comfortably, spending a
good deal of time at the Officers’ Club or aboard
ships in harbor, hobnobbing with his friends. The
second day after the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> return two
events of interest occurred.</p>

<p>The first was the arrival in port of four new
United States destroyers. They came gliding
in soon after sun-up, the Stars-and-Stripes fluttering
bravely, to a welcoming shriek of whistles
from anchored craft. Big, able ships they
were, long and low-cut abaft the forecastle,
but with staunch, stiff bows. Triple torpedo
tubes instead of twins: five-inch guns in the main
battery instead of fours: “all the modern improvements,”
as Garey phrased it, and a reputed
speed of thirty-four! Cheering and cheered, the
newcomers swept to anchorage, and officers debarked
and hurried shoreward to report to
headquarters on the Hill. Those fine, new sea-terrors
chirked everyone up immensely, and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
was a marked increase in patriotic fervor, or, at
least, in the expression of it. It was generally
conceded now that the Kaiser’s day was about
over! Even Ferris, although critical of several
features about the new craft, was heard to remark
that he guessed “the Limies couldn’t show
anything better.” Nelson got ashore in the afternoon
and met Tip and was secretly very proud
when Tip went into raptures over the new destroyers
and sighed for the command of one of them.</p>

<p>The second event arrived some twenty minutes
later and left Nelson momentarily breathless. He
and Tip were on the way to Police Headquarters
for a chat with the sergeant, who had become quite
a crony when, turning a corner, they ran plump
into a broad-shouldered American Jackie, who
emitted a blood-curdling yell and rushed upon
them. Tip squared off, resolved to sell his life
dearly, but Nelson, after a moment’s stupefaction,
began to yell too, and the bystanders were treated
to the sight of two hitherto apparently sane young
sailors locked in each other’s arms and doing a
sort of bear dance about the pavement.</p>

<p>Tip retired to a position of safety and grinned
sympathetically and counted “One, two, three!
One, two, three! Swing!” until, laughing breathlessly,
the two broke apart and became coherent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<p>“Nep, you old horse-thief!”</p>

<p>“Mart! Where’d you come from?”</p>

<p>“Right out of my little tin fish! She’s down the
harbor a ways. Got in this morning. I didn’t know
the old <i>Dry-an-rot</i> was here. Where’s she lying?
How are you? I say, owld de-ah, what’s happened
to your sleeve? Blow me, the lad’s been
promoted!”</p>

<p>“Mart, shake hands with Mr. Tipper. Tip,
you’ve heard me speak of Townsend.”</p>

<p>“Wot cheer, Townsend! As we say in dear old
Amurica, put her thar!”</p>

<p>“Glad to know you!” laughed Mart, shaking
hands. “You’re one of the Arizona Tippers, of
course. Can tell by your accent!”</p>

<p>“Right-o! Born and reared within sight of the
jolly old Missouri!”</p>

<p>Tip declared that the occasion demanded food
and drink and led the way to his favorite hostelry
where, for the better part of two hours, the trio
talked thirteen to the dozen and Mart recounted
his adventures up north and got his tongue so
twisted with Scottish words that Nelson feared for
him. “Oh, it’s all right if you like that sort
of thing,” declared Mart, “but excuse me! I got
so finally that, begging Mr. Tipperary’s pardon,
it would have been a grand relief to me if the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
Grand Fleet had sunk at its moorings! I was
never gladder to see the last of anything than
I was to watch Kinnaird Head lose itself in the
mist. It’s those horrible mists that make life
miserable up that way. And then the sea’s beastly,
too, most of the time. And cold! My word,
fellows, submerging in Moray is like going into an
ice-chest! Still, at that, it was interesting, and we
had our thrills. One of ’em came when we took
a practice plunge and something went wrong with
the tanks and we stayed on the bottom for seven
hours before we could get up again. Those little
things make life interesting. I never knew until
that day how many of us carried Bibles in our old
kit bags!”</p>

<p>“And what are you up to now, if I may ask?”
inquired Tip.</p>

<p>“You may ask, all right, friend, but don’t expect
me to tell you. They sent three of us down
here, but we don’t know why, unless it’s to get the
icicles out of the balance tanks. We had a weird
run of it, too, down that east coast of yours. Do
you know that there are exactly nine thousand different
currents along there? Well, there are. I
heard the Old Man say so, and he ought to know,
for he was on duty every minute. He’s ashore
now somewhere. I heard him say he was going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
to get a bath and a shave, but I’ll bet you anything
you like he’s filled himself with steak and onions
and gone to sleep!”</p>

<p>“Speaking of steak and onions,” murmured Tip
wistfully, “let’s eat something else.”</p>

<p>“Tell me where you got the decorations, Nep,”
said Mart, waving the suggestion of food aside
and nodding at Nelson’s right sleeve. “You don’t
have to salute me any more, do you? Not that
you ever did, though. What’s the big idea? You
in training to take Sims’ place?”</p>

<p>“’E’s a bloomin’ ’ero, ’e is,” explained Tip.
“Fought hoff the ’ole German Nivy, ’e did, and
got ’it in the ’ead and ain’t been the sime since!”</p>

<p>Nelson gave a brief account of the <i>Gyandotte’s</i>
adventure, aided by Tip, who supplied a deal of
interesting but scarcely credible matter, and Mart
declared warmly that he had always known “Nep
had it in him, by Jupiter!” After which, as Nelson
and Mart both refused to eat any more or
countenance the opening of further bottles of ginger
beer, the trio went out and sought adventures
along the water front. But adventures don’t happen
in Queenstown merely for the seeking, and
they finally parted after making an appointment
for the next day.</p>

<p>Nelson went back to the ship feeling very happy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
for it was good to have Mart around again. He
thought of a lot he meant to tell that youth at
the first opportunity, for he had always found
it easy to confide in him and was sure of sympathy,
but the opportunity for confidences didn’t arrive
until long after, as it happened. Mart and Tip
kept the appointment the next forenoon, but not
Nelson, and, after kicking their heels along the
quay for an hour, the two decided to pay a visit
to the <i>Gyandotte</i> and enjoy the ineffable pleasure
of watching Nelson work. Tip was certain of
a welcome and Mart saw no reason for being refused
on board, and so they engaged a waterman
and set forth.</p>

<p>Once aboard, Tip set off to visit the officers’
quarters as a matter of duty and politeness, and
Mart sought Nelson. “Sorry I couldn’t make it,”
said the latter when he had greeted his friend,
“but they’ve granted no liberty at all today, for
some reason. Looks as if we might be going out,
although we’re not due to until tomorrow. Want
to see what a real ship looks like?”</p>

<p>Mart said he did, and asked if there was one
in port. Presently, viewing the engine room, they
were joined by Tip, who had wrested himself from
the blandishments of the ward room officers. The
three were still making a lagging round of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
ship when one of the men, hurrying by, called to
Nelson: “Better get your friends off, Mate. We’re
pulling out!”</p>

<p>“Fine hospitality!” complained Mart: “Well,
be good, Nep. Come on, Tipperary, or we’ll be
on the briny!”</p>

<p>“I say,” was the response. “I’d rather like
it, you know. I wonder if they’d mind if I did.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask?” said Nelson. “I wish
you would. And I wish you might come, too,
Mart. You might stow away!”</p>

<p>“No, thanks! I’ve seen enough sea duty for
awhile. Me for shore and real food! Well, see
you all later.”</p>

<p>The anchors were already coming up and the
siren was blowing a warning as they gained the
deck. Mart looked over the side for the boat in
which they had made the trip from shore and
which had been instructed to wait for them. But
they had made the mistake of paying off their boatman
for the outward trip, and, like many happy-go-lucky
denizens of that port, he saw no cause
for further labor while there was a shilling in his
pocket. At all events, he was not there, and Mart
cast a dubious gaze about the harbor. Tip, who
had dashed off to obtain permission to remain
aboard and had got it, came back and went into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
fits of laughter over Mart’s quandary. Nowhere
was there a boat within signaling distance, and
everyone was far too busy to give ear to Mart’s
troubles. Nelson sought the officer of the deck
and held a hurried consultation, and presently returned
with word that, if they found a chance of
sending Mart back, they would do so, but that it
looked very much to the officer as if he would
have to swim or stay aboard!</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that’s all right,” said Mart. “I’ll
get Hail Columbia, of course, and be shot for
desertion, but who cares? I say, Nep, when you
get a chance see if you can persuade the radio
shark to report me to the <i>Q-4</i>, will you?”</p>

<p>Nelson agreed and hurried off to his station,
leaving Martin a bit worried and Tip chuckling.
The <i>Gyandotte</i> turned and passed down the channel,
signaling for the gate, and slid forth to the
sea in the glory of a sunshiny November afternoon.
Once past the mine fields she picked up her
heels and went plunging southward in the teeth
of a chill breeze dashing the foam from her bow
and playing a tune on her aerial that sounded like
the first efforts of a jew’s-harp performer. Although
Mart watched and hoped until Kinsale
Head was lost to sight, nothing offered in the way
of transportation back to Queenstown, and, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
that matter, and in spite of the officer’s promise, it
is extremely doubtful if the <i>Gyandotte</i> would have
slowed down to put him off. There was something
very determined and objective in the cruiser’s manner
this evening, and Nelson secretly believed that
nothing short of a “moldie” was likely to stop
her.</p>

<p>Mart accepted the situation at last and threw
off dull care. Nelson had succeeded in getting a
wireless back to the <i>Q-4</i> explaining the cause of
his desertion, and Mart declared that there was
no more to be done. He was made welcome in
Nelson’s mess and ate a good supper and was given
a hammock and a place to swing it. Tip was
not much in evidence that evening, but they
learned the next morning that he had slept most
comfortably on an improvised bunk in the ward
room. The cruiser met a heavy sea shortly before
midnight and performed quite a few fancy
steps between then and morning, and Mart, who
should have been inured to any sort of discomfort,
confessed the next day that the motion had
been so strange to him that he had not slept much!</p>

<p>What the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> original plan had been
they never learned, for about nine that morning
a messenger burst out of the wireless room
and scurried to the bridge and the cruiser promptly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
showed signs of increased activity below decks
and spouted blacker smoke and more of it and
wheeled south-westward. And some three minutes
later the whole ship’s company knew that
somewhere a U-boat was “strafing” an American
merchantman and that the little <i>Gyandotte</i> was
off to see about it!</p>

<small>THE CAPTAIN COMES ABOARD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Nelson and Tip and Martin leaned beside
Number Four gun and explained to
each other at great length and with much
vehemence just why there wasn’t the ghost of a
chance of the <i>Gyandotte</i> reaching the scene of
action in time to take a hand. And then, having
absolutely convinced themselves of that fact, they
at once proceeded to prove just as conclusively
that, being only sixty miles away when the message
was caught, it would be the easiest thing in the
world to arrive before it was too late. From
which you will gather, and rightly, that all three
wanted very much to have a finger in the pie and
were too anxious and excited to be consistent.</p>

<p>The <i>Gyandotte</i> was shaking from stem to stern
with the ardor of her engines and her two big
stacks were spouting smoke. A good twenty-three
miles an hour was what she was reeling
off, and had the sea been a bit less unfriendly she
might have bettered that by a fraction. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
bothered the cruiser’s men more than anything
else was the fear that another patrol boat or
convoy, either nearer to the scene or faster, had
picked up the wireless and would, in the words of
Mart, “beat them to it.” There was one thing
in their favor, however, which was that a low-lying
mist shrouded the ocean, and they might be
able to get within range of the U-boat before the
latter took warning. They well knew how such
jaunts usually ended. You pounded hard over
sixty or eighty or a hundred miles and found either
a lot of boats scattered over a ten mile radius
or a merchantman just dipping her bows under for
the final dive. Almost never did you glimpse the
enemy. Of course it was a fine and satisfactory
feat to rescue the steamer’s crew, but if only once
in a blue moon you might get in a few shots at the
Hun it would be a welcome variation!</p>

<p>In foretop cage the lookout strained aching
eyes through the haze, and all about the rail glasses
were leveled when, shortly after eleven, the
<i>Gyandotte</i> drew near the indicated position. Half
an hour before the final message had been caught
from the attacked vessel:</p>

<p>“S O S from O E L; please hurry, both engines
done in; one hold on fire; will have to abandon
soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>To this the <i>Gyandotte</i> had answered: “Be
with you forty minutes; don’t give up.”</p>

<p>As there had come no further message it was
feared that the merchantman, the American
“Three L” liner <i>Antietam</i>, had been forced to
surrender. At seven-thirty the General Quarters
alarm sounded and the crew went to stations. A
few minutes afterwards the foretop lookout reported
smoke one point off the starboard bow and
presently a deck lookout reported “something to
port, sir, low on the water! Might be the sub!”
A moment’s search from the bridge and then,
over the fire control system sped range and deflection.</p>

<p>“<em>Number Four! Are you on?</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>On, sir!</em>”</p>

<p>Seven thousand yards away over the port bow
lay a faint something that might have been a dead
whale until a flare of light shot through the mist
from it and the sound of a shell came across the
water. Further off, to starboard, a cloud of low-hanging
smoke indicated the position of the <i>Antietam</i>,
and it was toward this mark that the shell
sped.</p>

<p>“<em>Ready!</em>” called Garey. “<em>Fire!</em>”</p>

<p>Number Four barked sharply as Nelson closed
the contact. A dozen yards short of the submarine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
a column of water shot into the air. The
spotter sent his correction of range. The elevating
wheel moved slightly. A new shell was thrust
in and the breech was closed.</p>

<p>“Ready!”</p>

<p>The target was growing smaller, sinking from
sight now!</p>

<p>Again the gun spat and an instant of breathless
anxiety followed. Then a cheer, shrill and wild,
went up from the Number Four crew. The submarine’s
conning tower, low-set between slanting
wave-breakers, crumpled up as the five-inch shell
struck it fairly!</p>

<p>“Got her!” shouted Garey, peering along the
gun. “Give her another, boys! Hurry up, with
that powder! Ram her! <em>Ready!</em>”</p>

<p>Number Two gun was firing now, but her range
was short. Nelson again shot the spark and again
the gun barked, but this time the shell passed over
the target. The submarine was still awash. Why
didn’t they submerge? Well, if they wanted
more——</p>

<p>Number Two landed a shell under the stern
and the U-boat plunged and rolled.</p>

<p>“<em>Ready!</em>” cried Garey.</p>

<p>Number Four spoke again and the forward
fair-water flattened and the riddled tower disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
as though a giant hand had swept it into
the sea. The U-boat canted. Nelson, darting a
look across the water, wondered. Holding the
gun on the target, he waited for the thud of the
closing breech and Garey’s “Ready!” Something
was moving on the deck of the U-boat, an uncertain
something amidst the tangled and twisted
wreckage. The breech closed.</p>

<p>“<em>Rea</em>—” Garey’s voice broke. “<em>Cease firing!</em>”</p>

<p>“They’re coming up!” That was Tip, until
the moment a silent if thrilled spectator.</p>

<p>“They’re surrendering!” That was Garey, in
hoarse triumph.</p>

<p>The U-boat arose, dripping, rocking drunkenly,
on an uneven keel, her stern down and her sharp
bow well out of water, and through the gaping
hole amidship crawled men. One—two—three—and
still they came, arms upheld in token of surrender,
feet slipping on the wet, slanting deck.
One fell, clutching wildly at the air, and disappeared
into the water. He came up again and
found a hold on something and clung there. None
offered to help him back. The deck was lined
with the Germans now and more were fighting at
the torn hatchway. The <i>Gyandotte</i> slowed and
swung nearer. Across the silence came, faintly,
confused cries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>“‘Kamerad!’” muttered a shellman disgustedly.
“I’d ‘kamerad’ the swine if I had my way!”</p>

<p>Over went the boats while the cruiser, with propellers
idle, sidled closer through the leaping
waves. The submarine’s bow rose higher and
higher and it was evident that she would soon go
down stern-first. Some of those on the deck,
jostled by their companions, slid off into the water.
Others deliberately plunged in and began to swim
toward the battleship. From Number Four gun
port they saw the boats halving the distance.</p>

<p>“I’d let ’em swim,” said Garey. “They’ve all
got life-vests on, every one of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Every Hun of them,” corrected Tip softly.
He plucked at Mart’s sleeve. “Let’s go topside
and have a look.”</p>

<p>One of the small boats was pulling the Germans
from the water, while the other went on toward
the submarine on which some ten or a dozen
men still maintained a precarious foothold on the
forward deck. The numbers on the bow were
easily read now: “<i>U C 46</i>”; and it was possible
to pick out the officers by the tarnished gold braid
on sleeves and caps. The <i>Gyandotte’s</i> propellers
churned and the cruiser stopped and swung her
bow to starboard. Signals were fluttering to the
<i>Antietam</i>, promising speedy assistance. The small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
boats were coming back, loaded to the water’s
edge. Number Four’s crew leaned out and gazed
curiously down at the prisoners as they passed toward
the boom. A sorry, dejected looking lot
they were, thought Nelson. The commander, a
tall, yellow-bearded man, was talking to the ensign
in charge of the boat, smiling faintly as he
gazed up toward the deck. The second boat, filled
with dripping men who had been pulled out of
the sea, passed next. On the faces of the sailors
was a vague terror as they, too, looked apprehensively
upward.</p>

<p>“They’re expecting to be shot, I suppose,” said
Jennings. “Well, they deserve it, but they won’t
be. They’ll have a nice easy life of it until the
war’s over. And plenty to eat, too, and, judging
by the looks of ’em now, that’s something that’ll
be welcome.”</p>

<p>Nelson, gazing down, felt a tinge of compassion
for the captives. They looked so hopelessly resigned
to the fate they imagined awaited them.
One moon-faced fellow had the temerity to smile
up at the clustered rail, but the others scowled sullenly.
In the middle of the boat one taller than
the rest sat with head dropped on his hands, the
picture of dejection.</p>

<p>“<em>Secure!</em>” came the command over the control,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
and Nelson and the others set about washing and
oiling the bore and setting the gun in order. Meanwhile
the fire and rescue signal had been given and
the <i>Gyandotte</i>, turning her back on the sinking
submarine, approached the merchantman. The
fire and rescue party pulled around to the further
side, out of the low-hanging smoke, and disappeared
from sight. When the smoke lifted momentarily
the <i>Antietam</i> showed herself a smart-looking
freighter of some six thousand tons. But
the German shells had worked sad havoc. Her
decks were littered and both stacks were gashed
by shrapnel. At least a dozen shots had taken
effect on her hull and she was badly down by the
head. It was half an hour before Number Four
gun was secured and Nelson was free to return
to the main deck to see what was going on. He
found Martin and Tip there, and, grimy and oil-stained
as he was, stopped for a moment’s talk by
the rail.</p>

<p>“Nep, you’re some little shootist,” declared
Martin. “That second effort of yours was a work
of art. You’ve got a good joke on Number Two
gun, by the way. They got the word as soon as
you fellows, but they had a mis-fire. They’re a
mad lot.”</p>

<p>“Hard luck,” said Nelson. “What I want to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
know, though, is why the sub didn’t submerge
when they saw us coming up. It wasn’t a bit like
their usual style.”</p>

<p>“We got all that,” said Tip. “If there’s anything
you wish to know, sir, enquire within. It
seems the sub didn’t submerge for the excellent
reason that it couldn’t. Someone——”</p>

<p>“The American, of course,” interrupted Martin.
“They’ve got him back in the Old Man’s
quarters now. Sure to have been him. What
would you have done under the——”</p>

<p>“Quite so, old dear, quite so! That was their
mistake, wasn’t it? Took an American prisoner
aboard, Troy, as a member of the crew. Funny
thing, I say, but I heard months ago that they
were having a hard time manning the subs. Well,
he cooked their goose for them, what?”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” asked Nelson.
“Do you mean that there was an American aboard
that boat?”</p>

<p>“Just so! And he did something to their
tanks——”</p>

<p>“Broke the valves, probably,” corrected Martin.
“Don’t see just how he could, either. Still,
they say he did. If he had——”</p>

<p>“You mean he fixed the boat so it couldn’t
dive?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the way we got it. One of your fellows
was talking to a petty officer and he says
this American——”</p>

<p>“But how did an American come to be in the
crew?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was a prisoner and they needed men
and just took him. Suppose they told him he’d
have to do it or be shot. That’s about the way
they’d put it, I fancy. I dare say he agreed in the
hope that some time he’d either be able to escape
or”—Tip shrugged his shoulders—“drown himself
and the rest of them. That’s what I’d do if
they put it to me like that.”</p>

<p>“An American!” exclaimed Nelson. “Did you
see him?”</p>

<p>“Not close. They took him back to the Old
Man. He’s there yet, I guess.” Martin looked
back along the deck. “They’ve got the officers
there, too. One of them——”</p>

<p>“What is it, Troy?” cried Tip. “I say, you
don’t think——”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” muttered Nelson, wide-eyed,
tremulous.</p>

<p>Martin stared uncomprehendingly for an instant.
Then: “By Jove!” he exclaimed awedly.
“Nep, it couldn’t be, could it? Listen! This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
man’s tall and thin; looked sort of half-starved;
grayish hair, I think——”</p>

<p>“Gray?” faltered Nelson. Then he shook his
head, and: “It probably isn’t,” he said. “Dad’s
hair is brown, about like mine. I thought—maybe——”</p>

<p>“Hold up!” cried Tip. “Anyone’s hair might
be gray after a year in a German prison camp!”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” agreed Martin.</p>

<p>Nelson looked from one to the other anxiously.
“Do you think—it could be?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t hope too hard,” muttered Martin.</p>

<p>Nelson stared thoughtfully at his grimy hands
and then over toward where the <i>Antietam</i> lay, the
smoke lessening about her torn deck. Finally:
“I guess I’ll go and—and make sure,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Right-o!” said Tip cheerfully. “Like me to
go along, old man?”</p>

<p>Nelson shook his head, smiling faintly. “No,
because it mayn’t be, and—and then I—I guess
I don’t want anyone around!”</p>

<p>At the after companion he halted. He had no
right to go where he was going without orders.
And what should he say? Perhaps he had better
wait....</p>

<p>But he went on. In the wardroom passage he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
paused again. Through a partly open door ahead
came faint voices, for the ship with its idle engines
was very still. He listened, his heart beating
hard and chokingly. That was the captain
talking now: “... After what you’ve been
through, Captain ... make you comfortable
... find some clothes....” Then another
voice came to the listener, a deeper voice, speaking
slowly, wearily....</p>

<p>Nelson went forward like one in a dream. The
door of the captain’s cabin stood half open. On
the threshold he stopped and raised his hand in
salute, and the captain, glancing up, saw him.</p>

<p>“Well, my man?” he demanded sharply.</p>

<p>The second occupant of the cabin was hidden
by the door.</p>

<p>Nelson answered in a queer, weak voice: “Beg
pardon, sir. May I speak to my father?”</p>

<p>“Eh? To your father!” The captain’s gaze
swept perplexedly from Nelson to the tall, gaunt
figure in the chair beside him. “Bless my soul!
What—what——”</p>

<p>The man beside him was on his feet, and striding
to the door, had thrown it open.</p>

<p>“<em>Bless my soul!</em>” repeated the captain.</p>

<p>“Nelson, boy! Is it you?” cried the stranger.</p>

<p>Nelson’s arms went out and he clung to the tall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
figure with straining grasp of dirty, oil-stained
hands.</p>

<p>“Gee, Dad, I thought you were dead!” he
sobbed.</p>

<p>The captain blew his nose loudly, and: “Bless
my soul!” he said. “Bless my soul!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Twilight crept out of the east over leagues of
empty sea. The <i>Antietam</i>, patched and tinkered,
hobbled slowly toward the oncoming darkness. A
mile away the <i>Gyandotte</i> kept her company. A
few miles astern a spreading patch of oil marked
the grave of the <i>U C 46</i>. For the rest all was
tumbling sea, gray green ahead, glinting with copper
lights behind where the last rays of the sun
touched it. Somewhere behind the darkening
horizon lay the shores of France—and safety for
the wounded, corpse-laden <i>Antietam</i>.</p>

<p>In a quiet niche of the lower deck a little group
sat and talked after supper. Two of them sat
very close together, a tall, thin man with grayish
hair and a smiling, wistfully happy youth of
eighteen. With them were Martin and Tip and
Garey. Captain Troy had told his story for them
and they had listened raptly. They had heard
how, after the explosion of the first shell aboard
the <i>Jonas Clinton</i>, he had come to himself in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
water, and how, dazed by a blow on the head and
consequently unconscious, he had vainly tried to
get back to the schooner, and had only recovered
full consciousness days later, when he found himself
lying in a bunk in the submarine. They had
treated him fairly enough and had landed him a
week later on German soil. After that he had
been taken, with many other prisoners of war, to
a great prison camp in East Prussia. He had
been there almost a year when he and nearly a
hundred others of many nationalities, all of whom
had been sailors, were packed into cars and
shipped westward again. At some port—the Captain
believed it to have been Bremerhaven—they
had been given their choice of going onto the submarines
or working on the fortifications on Heligoland.
Captain Troy had hesitated but a moment.
The sea was his home and, once afloat
again, he believed he could make his escape. But
there had never been a chance. He had been the
only prisoner aboard and they had watched his
every movement. The <i>U C 46</i> had been out
nearly three weeks before she had sighted her
first prey, the <i>Antietam</i>. By that time Captain
Troy had in a measure gained the confidence of
the officers and crew and was given work in the
engine room. His chance had come that day when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
the U-boat had gone to the surface and the crew
had been serving the deck guns or watching the
destroying of the merchantman. He had not tampered
with the valves, for he had not known how
to, but, finding a moment when he had the motor
room to himself, he had managed to disconnect
and short-circuit the main feed cable between battery
and dynamo. He had expected to be found
out and killed, but, with the <i>Gyandotte’s</i> shells
raining about them, the officers of the U-boat had
been too confused to trace the trouble. Finding
that the motors would not work and that they
could not submerge, they had blown out the tanks
again and surrendered. Evidently no suspicion
had attached to him, for he had been allowed to
follow the others on deck, from where he had
leaped overboard and tried to reach the cruiser.</p>

<p>“And now, sir,” asked Tip when the tale was
ended, “what will you do?”</p>

<p>“Get back home as soon as I can,” replied the
Captain unhesitatingly, “and find another ship.
She’ll be steam this time, I guess. And she’ll
have a gun and a gun-crew aboard her, and all
I’m asking is that one of those dirty ‘fishes’ will
poke her pipes up where I can see ’em!”</p>

<p>“I wish I was going to be along,” said Nelson.
“I’d like to point that gun for you, dad!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>“Then come. I’d be mighty glad to have you,
boy.”</p>

<p>But Nelson shook his head slowly. “I guess
not, sir. I think I’ll stay right here. I suppose
I couldn’t change if I wanted to, and I don’t want
to. No, sir, I’ll stick and see it out on the <i>Gyandotte</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well, just as you say, Nelson. I’d like to have
you with me, but you seem to fit pretty well where
you are. Maybe it won’t be for long now, son.
There’s got to be an end of it some time.”</p>

<p>“And it’s going to be the right end, when it
comes,” said Tip emphatically. “No half-way
business, Captain Troy. We’re going to fight
Germany to her knees, sir!”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir, I hope we will! I wish I was young
enough to take a hand! But I ain’t. Nelson
here’ll have to do my fighting for me, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Martin, “he seems to be able
to! Eh, Tipperary?”</p>

<p>“Rather! What price Number Four gun?
Speech, Mr. Garey!”</p>

<p>Garey smiled quietly. “Number Four speaks
for herself! And,” he added, “every time she
speaks she says something!”</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Nelson, “I wouldn’t like any
other gun so well. Nor any other ship so well.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
So I guess we’ll see it through together until we
get what we came after, the little old <i>Gyandotte</i>
and I.”</p>

<p>“Victory for the Allies!” said Tip.</p>

<p>“Peace for the whole world,” added Martin.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nelson soberly, “and the Freedom
of the Seas!”</p>

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
